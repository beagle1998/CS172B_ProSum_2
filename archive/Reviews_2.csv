We tried two different kinds of similac including for fussiness and gas and neither seemed to work. We switched to the organic a few weeks ago and saw quick improvement. I wish I could breast feed but I'm unable to, so for now this seems the best option especially since it was recommended we stick with a ready made formula for the gas problems.<br />Ive read a lot of the reviews and took into consideration the information about sucrose. I plan on talking to the pediatrician and my midwife for additional information beyond the article written about it, especially since that is from 2008. I realize the concern and I am doing research on making my own formula so I know exactly whats in it and that its organic, but in the mean time baby L eats great with this, is healthy, and has fewer stomach problems.

He did.  However, I really wanted to use organic formula so I added a few teaspoons of prunes to his cereal and within 12 hours - problem solved.  No constipation since and he has been on this formula for about 2 weeks. I give him some prune/cereal every 4 days.  If your baby is not yet on solids you might consider giving him a little apple or pear juice mixed with water.  This should do the trick also.  Don't let the constipation issue scare you off."

Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as ""necessary vitamins and minerals,"" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and ""other"" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from ""natural""<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe.

Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs.

She winced and cried and worked so long to just produced a hard ball the size of ping pong ball.  It was horrible!  I realized I was the one helping her poo with nursing and then she lost all ability when she went full-formula.  I say switch....
10005,B000P41A28,A3A6QXIC8XCOJG,Vladimir Dyo,9,20,1,1231804800,Constipation!!!!!,"We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, ""Is my child really constipated?""<br /><br />Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.<br /><br />So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />Top<br /><br />Bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac® that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />Top<br /><br />Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * I use a lot of Karo® corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  Before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: ""Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember""<br /><br />  ""In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.""<br /><br />  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac®, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />Top<br /><br />Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo®, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.<br /><br />Top"

Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia, it also tastes very good.

Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.  I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days.  One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles.  But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon!  Could the Chia have helped?  I think so.  I certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when ""on"" the Chia.<br /><br />I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Chia powder, but have since started buying them on Amazon for a fraction of the price. My suggestion is to get some Chia and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible."

I have to say...this stuff is terrific.  I put 3 TBs (1 serving) in about 1/4 cup of warm filtered water, and stirred it, and watched as it kind of puffed up...tasted it...and you know what?  It kind of tasted like oatmeal or barley.  I intended to add this slurry into my green smoothie, but I liked the way it tasted so much, I just ate it with a spoon.<br /><br />My recommendation is to add a little warm water to the powder, and stir it up before mixing it into whatever you are eating--or just eat it straight as I did.<br /><br />I'm going to buy this brand in bulk at Amazon--and I'll make sure it is the sprouted powder and not the seeds.<br /><br />By the way, I read on a review posted about the Navitas chia SEEDS that they make a kind of ""tapioca"" by adding coconut or almond milk and stevia to the chia seeds...so I tried doing that with the powder...it created a kind of soft, puffy pudding texture, and it was definitely in the ""treat"" category."

I tried different times in my microwave but found it best to watch and take them out as soon as the bag stops rising.  You will sometimes have some that did not expand(you can pop these back in the microwave to try and revive them) but it is not worth burning some of them to try to ensure all have expanded."

And the price is good.<br /><br />First, it takes a little learning to figure out how to cook these. The instructions are not much help. ""Stop cooking when the bag stops expanding""....they might as well say, perform a Vulcan mind meld with the pork rinds to know when they are done. I found that the bag's expansion--or not---has little to do with whether they are done. I have a 1200 watt microwave and 1:30 was perfect. 1:00 and they were not cooked, 2:00 and I had charcoal bits.<br />I had to sacrifice a couple of precious bags to figure this out.<br /><br />Taste and texture? Well they are infinitely better than bags of pork rinds from the store. The texture is very good. The taste? I am in no way shy of salty food, love me some salt! But these were borderline too much for me. I did sprinkle some cinnamon and Ideal on them to make them sweet and I still had a hard time eating them. My husband liked them this way though.<br /><br />If they could back off the strong salty flavor, I would buy these again. As it is, I'm going to use them to make low-carb nachos. I won't be reordering them though. Love the crispy texture! But can't choke down the overpowering saltiness."

Modern technology has enabled us to produce the epitome of snack foods in a hot, fresh version.  I will be relegated no more to the listless depths of popped corn.  Pork rinds are the ultimate man chips. Very similar to microwaved popcorn, you just shake the bag and put em in your microwave for about 2 min and voila, hot fresh pork rinds.  When you pop them you have to get accustomed to the fact that they don't ""pop"" like popcorn - they just crackle a bit.  So it is a bit hard to tell when they are done and usually through trial and error you will get the perfect time depending upon the type of microwave oven you use.  Mine is 900W and takes just under 2 min. A couple of pieces will get burnt, or as I affectionately refer to as char. The bag will inflate slightly.  When they are done, you open it up and you are greeted with an aroma that is bacon heaven.  Put one in your mouth right away and it will stick to your tongue like a live octopus.  They are a bit salty so they make the perfect accompaniment to a nice cold beer.  I didn't find them too spicy, just enough.  If you want to be creative, you can throw em in a bowl right after they are done popping and throw some salsa verde or any other kind of salsa you have.  You will be greeted with a chorus of wonderful snaps like getting sizzling rice soup at a Chinese restaurant.  Throw on some shredded cheese and the result is ""man nachos"".  My wife thinks that it is utterly disgusting, even though that hasn't stopped her from eating them.  Trust me, they are delicious, but don't let em sit too long or they get soggy."

These little gems cook up light and crispy right from the microwave. They have a mildly spicy flavor that builds up as you make way through the serving but the heat never gets too powerful. The key to getting the best yield is to shake the bag before cooking. That will distribute the pellets evenly. Then you have to find the ""sweet spot"" for cooking time. Mine is 2 min 30 sec which leaves me with no burnt or uncooked pieces. I only have two minor criticisms: 1) The serving size is a little small and 2)the spice mixture is a tad bit too salty for me.

The bags contain what appear to be chips of pork skin that were parboiled in salt water, then flattened under high pressure.  Be sure to shake them around to distribute them throughout the bag before cooking.  They expand considerably in the bag during 1:00 to 2:00 of nuking, depending on the wattage, etc., but it is a slow expansion, unlike the vigorous popping of corn.  Also, the bag  only expands about half as much as with popcorn.  When ready, these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep-fried, but these are far tastier, fresher, AND MUCH LOWER IN FAT AND CALORIES.  A whole bag is 210 calories, about 50 calories from fat.  This is less than the low-fat microwave popcorn I use.  One bag, however, has 50% of the daily salt limit for an adult.<br /><br />I especially like these sprinkled with garlic powder and dried marjoram (together).  Other herbs and spices are interesting variations, such as sage or cumin or whatever else might appeal to you."

Some bags were saltier than others, but we've cooked up about 5 so far and the majority aren't overly salty.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be. In our 1100 watt oven 40-43 seconds seems to be just right.<br /><br />The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy.<br /><br />Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs. I'm still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring.<br /><br />I wish they'd put out a version that didn't have seasoned salt as I'd like them with just salt and/or garlic."

The spicy version is not very spicy, but has a little kick. Be careful to even out the contents of the bag before microwaving and to make sure the bag rotates freely in microwaves with a turntable. Microwave time is short, about 90 seconds. They come out hot and fresh tasting. Pieces are relatively small, about an inch square. They have a less intense pork flavor than the best pork rinds, but having them hot helps compensate. Amazingly, pork rinds are becoming ""diet food."" They have no carbs, there is a lot of air in them that minimizes the calories for the volume, and relatively small quantities are satisfying. Anyway, it is a good story to go with a tasty snack."

Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning.

I had the same issues with some of the others who've bought them in that finding out how long to microwave them with your particular microwave is a trial and error process on the first bag or two. On my first attempt, they ""fluffed-up"" fine, but I ended up microwaving them too long and some of them started to scorch (leaving a bad burnt smell, though not quite as bad as popcorn when the same thing happens). Spreading them out inside the bag before you start to microwave them is probably the single most important thing you can do. It's a little tricky, but you can get them to move around a bit with minimal effort. If you just throw the bag in the microwave as if it's popcorn, you won't get a quality product, but if you take the time to spread them out (as stated on the bag) and then watch the bag until it stops expanding (again, stated on the bag), they're quite good.<br /><br />Once you get the hang of it, the Bacon Curls are pretty delicious, especially paired with a beer or two (something pale and drinkable, from a ""yard work"" kind of beer to something like an IPA). The curls/rinds are light and fluffy, but very crunchy (surprisingly so, I was halfway expecting there to be some kind of greasy sogginess, but there isn't). They're on the salty side, but again, with the beer, that's a good thing. I like how they come out of the package sizzling and popping a bit, warm (not hot) and delicious. If you already like pork rinds, then this is almost a no brainer, as this is the same thing, only better (fresh, warm, delicious and with less fat)."

Ours is pretty strong, and 1 minute 40 to 50 seconds is about right. However, BE WARNED! If you have an inexpensive or ""low power"" oven, the results will be very poor at best. (Just ask the crew where I work) When I tried to make a bag in the company cheap oven, it was SUPER slow to expand, and after the better part of 4 minutes, the burnt smell forced then to keep the door to the break room open for the rest of the afternoon! Bottom line....if you don't have a quality oven, don't buy these. One last word. After you remove the bag from the oven, carefully open, shake, and simply blow on them until they stop crackling. Otherwise they will seem stale until they cool. All this sounds like a pile of work, but after the first couple bags, you will NEVER buy pork rinds at the store again.

The cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though. I have a 1000w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag. The first bag I tried with 1 minute, and additional 15 second intervls, stopping at 1min, 15 seconds. Several skins had not yet cooked. So I rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. Still some did not fully ""explode"" or ""bloom"".  The second bag I started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. Slightly better results, but again I needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results.  The third bag I started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. Too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat.<br />My suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (They emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  As soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result.  This item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. To me anyway.  The jury is still out on whether the ""healthy"" claim can hold water.  I will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion.  Good Eats!"

I love pork rinds. Usually I buy a tub of them from Sam's, but since I'm the only one in the house who eats them, they go stale long before I can make a dent in them. So I saw these, and the positive reviews, and thought, ""Hey, that's the perfect solution!"". It's a perfect solution all right...a perfect solution to get me to stop eating pork rinds.<br /><br />I made the first bag, as per the directions. I had no problem with them crisping at all. They were perfect in that regard, nice and crunchy. But the taste is awful! I thought, perhaps, it was a bad bag. Nope. The second batch tasted just as terrible. I have no idea what they use to flavor them, but it tastes like a strange mixture of salt and soap. There's enough salt in them to kill a horse, which in and of itself wouldn't be so bad (I actually like salty things) but when combined with whatever garbage they dug out of their backed up shower and called seasoning, it left me hunting for listerine - or gasoline, whatever I could get my hands on - to get the taste out of my mouth. I'm still shuddering from it. If you like the taste of feet, go for it. If not, I'd suggest heading to Sam's to buy the wonderful tasting pork rinds we all know and love."

All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.

The MSG also heightens the very salty taste. This item did puff up very nicely in the microwave, but it was inedible because of the saltiness and all 18 packages had to be thrown out.

I made sure that I unfolded the package (it's folded into three just like a microwave popcorn pack), unbent the folds so that the product could move between the three areas, then I shook it vigorously several times, trying to distribute the contents somewhat evenly throughout the bag.  Two minutes in my microwave (1100 Watts, but 10 years old) is perfect, and virtually all rinds pop every time.<br /><br />This is a low fat product, so it isn't nearly as tasty as the supermarket pork rinds you may have tried.  One could easily eat an entire package, although there are three servings per bag, but you will pay the consequences in terms of salt intake and MSG overload.  The MSG triggered a migraine for me, so now I don't eat it frequently, and make sure I only consume half a bag at most.  When I get near the bottom of the bag, where the most salt and MSG ends up, I try to brush off as much as I can.<br /><br />Still, a good snack option for those with blood sugar sensitivities.  Zero carbs is always good! The only reason for my 4 star review is that the amount of MSG per bag seems to be pretty high, and that's not disclosed on the product's Amazon page."

I found that you want to start at the low end of the cooking time and work up. For me about 3 bags was enough to figure out that 1:08 was the 'perfect' time for my microwave. Long enough that they all 'pop' but not so long that anything happens to the early 'poppers'.<br /><br />My daughter loves them also, and we are going through them at a pretty good clip. I'm going to put them on auto reorder when this batch is gone. They are perfect for evening snacking when the mood hits. Since you make them as you eat them, never a stale bag!

I've had pork rinds from the stores and thought they were pretty good, so I expected this to be at or better than my local convenience store brand.  Wrong.  I was first disappointed with the texture.  After following the instructions to microwave from 1-2 minutes, some (about 1/4) were crispy, but the rest were almost like taffy and would stick to the teeth?  Perhaps I didn't cook long enough, so 2nd bag stayed in longer which made a few more crispy, but more burnt and chewy ones.  But texture is only 1/2 the problem, the biggest issue was that the product taste like the bag. The taste of the microwave bag seems to bake into the product giving them a paper bag taste.  Finally,those without the full paper bag taste didn't really have a lot of flavor.  They were salty (which is to be expected),but that's really all the flavor you get.  So if your desperate and too lazy to get out a store (or can't find any in a near by store), this may work for you.  It  works out to about $1.00 a bag, so I'm not totally disappointed as my dog loves them.  By the way, my dog gives them 5 stars."

You really need to get them dispersed in the bag before popping if you want full big puffy pork rinds, which I think needs to be done more than 5-6 times like the directions state.  Some bags do seem fuller than others, however.  I have to agree these do stink when taken out of the microwave.  I turn my stove fan on before taking them out of the microwave and pour them out of the bag under the fan and hold the bag and bowl up to the fan for a few seconds.<br />I've tried dipping these into ranch dressing which is a bit of a treat too, but seems to make the porky too soggy, but I like the taste of it."

It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.<br /><br />I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it.

Because you can buy a lot of good stuff cheap (meaning ""cost effective"")and have it delivered in two days for free!  How can you hate that?

I have actually corrected his intent because I think he was trying to be too Politically Correct; that is ""Distrust and Verify"". You must ALWAYS shop and reshop, internet and retail, to see what makes Price Sense.<br /><br />To the point: I can buy the 40 Oz. (2-1/2 Lb.) bag of B&J Kona Blend coffee beans in the decorative bag for $16.99 (No Sales Tax in MA) at my local BJ's.  An aggressive Amazon.Com Marketplace Seller is offering the same item for $40.69 plus $8.24 shipping, $48.93 Total.  I will not dignify the sellers price by speculating what the profit margin might be or what the final Unit Price results in.  You be the judge. All I can say again is ""Distrust and Verify"".<br /><br />P.S.  I defend the right of a company to gouge their customers.  That's what Capitalism and America are all about.

I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea.

I used to avoid granola cereals because they were hard to chew.  A friend visited, brought a box of Nature's Path Pumpkin Flax Granola, and forgot to take it when he left.  So, I tried it.  I was hooked immediately.  Not only was it tasty, but it wasn't jaw-breaking hard.  It wasn't mush either.  Perfection.<br /><br />The only problem with this cereal is the price.  For someone on a fixed income trying to eat right, it's expensive.  It is hard to find it for less than $4-5/box and that's just too much for me to spend on a small box of cereal.  I bought this bulk package from Amazon when it was on a super sale, but on accident I didn't hit auto renew and the price went back up.  When it goes back down I'll renew, but until then it's other places that are cheaper.  These are Fred Meyer in bulk and Trader Joe's ($2.89/box).  The best price is Fred Meyer.<br /><br />Make sure that you chew the cereal good.  The flax seeds are whole.  If they enter the body whole, they EXIT whole as well, and that means you get zero nutrient from them.  So, chew it up!<br /><br />It's EXCELLENT with So Delicious Coconut Milk, a non-dairy, non-soy drink.  I just use it for this cereal.

It's not Kraft Mac & Cheese but I like it a lot better than Kraft! It's zesty and peppery and it does taste like cheese.<br /><br />I thought that the 3 tablespoons of oil they say to mix the ""cheez"" sauce with was excessive.  I used one teaspoon of oil and 1/2 cup of the cooking water I reserved from the pasta and let it simmer while stirring for a few minutes to thicken.  Then I added the pasta and green beans that I cooked with the pasta.  It was really tasty!  The macaroni, which was a nice texture and cooked up beautifully, has ridges to hold the sauce.  Do not over cook the pasta though, it needs maybe 8 1/2 or 9 minutes.<br /><br />It's just way too expensive.  I really think Namaste Foods could make money and still price this much better to be affordable for the average person.  No need to price gouge people who have food sensitivities and parents who have children with Celiac Disease.  I know this type of product costs more to produce because of the need for a dedicated facility and the special ingredients but your prices are ridiculous.<br /><br />Most families are on a strict budget especially in these days of poor economy and job losses.

I was expecting something that tasted vaguely like pasta with cheese sauce. I had only recently developed a total dairy intolerance on top of the gluten problem, so was having very bad experiences with ""cheez"" & cheese subsitutes. Every one I've tried has been uniformly hideous, so it's not like I had high hopes for this dish. It is not even remotely cheese-like (or even ""cheez-like""), and hoping for something that tastes within screaming distance of cheese messes up one's expectations something awful. However, I found if I approach this dish after erasing all thoughts of 'cheesishness' from my mind & tastebuds, it's quite good. Actually describing the taste is a bit of a challenge...it's got tons of flavor, not hot-spicy but turmeric/onion/garlic/paprica/butterish/something... maybe it's the hemp seed that gives it the indescribable yumminess I can't begin to compare with anything I'm familiar with. Whatever the heck it is, I find myself madly craving it quite often.<br /><br />As it comes out of the package, it's not creamy at all , though one can up the creaminess by adding whatever milk substitute you prefer, & I've also added 'fake cream cheese' to it with decent creamy results.<br /><br />Still, I wish they'd get rid of the 'cheeselike' claims & call it something else; it seems to me it'd better prepare folks for liking it, thus increasing the sales, thus BRINGING DOWN THE PRICE, which is my main complaint with this & all the Namaste foods. I really feel like too often those of us with real, severe, dietary restrictions --who have no choice in a specialty diet as opposed to those who are ""going gluten free"" as a way of jumping on a fad bandwagon-- are being budgetarily scr....er, shafted by specialty food makers.<br /><br />If anyone has been introduced to Cincinnati chili as an adult without adequate prior preparation, the shock experience of this pasta mix is something akin to that. I grew up on Cinci chili & have a lifelong addiction, but if you approach it expecting something like good ole texas chili with meat 'n' tomato 'n' beans, your taste buds are in for one heckuva shock. Those with no preconceived notions frequently love the stuff, but it is very, very different from traditional chili, having been concocted by Greeks."

Khannah-Brown""",1,1,5,1190764800,"Romantic, Natural, Unique Tea Experience","*****<br />White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is an exciting and unusual premium Numi tea. It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: ""Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair."" I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"

Now I've discovered on my own how to do it RIGHT.<br /><br />  If you want perfect popcorn, here's my secret:<br />- Add 2-3 ounces of oil in popper + 3 kernels;<br />- On electric stove (yeah, I know) set burner between 8 and 9 on scale of 1 to 10. (If you set it for 10, you'll have small, lousy, and even unpopped results. Who knew!)<br />- When the 3 kernels pop, add 1/3 cup of kernels (any more than this and they'll spill over)<br />- Meanwhile, melt 1/4 to 1/3 of ONE cube of butter in microwave for 35 seconds.<br />- When popped, (turn the whirley handle to prevent popped corn from overheating / or shake your pot (the one on the stove) if you lack this popper) and pour into your favorite bowl, (don't put butter into your popcorn cooker) drizzling butter and sprinkling a smidgen of salt.<br /><br />  The very best you've ever had . . . true?<br /><br />Another Tip: I deliberately make extra, putting the rest into a FoodSaver airtight canister.

Note that you only get six cookies in the whole box.  The cookies are surprisingly light and crispy.  Definitely sweet, but not overly so, unlike many other Keebler products.

They are a wonderful source of protein without the carbs, salt, and extra sugar that come with other snacks or with roasted nuts (e.g., especially honey-roasted nuts).<br /><br />These whole, raw almonds are great for anyone with a blood sugar issue.  The raw almonds won't make your blood sugar spike; are handy if your blood sugar has dropped and you need a quick source of food; and, the 1.5-ounce bags are sturdy and won't rip--or haven't yet in my overly packed and oft-mangled bag.<br /><br />As the previous reviewer mentioned, once you start eating these, you won't miss the added fat and salt of any distributor's ""roasted"" nuts.  Since eating these natural almonds, I haven't missed the traditional ""roasted"" nut taste.  I grew up on the usual nuts, but now I find I really look forward to this new, clean taste.  For all these reasons, I recommend Blue Diamond's raw almonds.<br /><br />(However, if you still think that these almonds aren't crunchy enough for you--especially if you bought the canned nuts--you could always roast them yourself.  Put the raw almonds on a cookie sheet [you may want to line your sheet with foil or parchment paper] in a pre-heated oven at 350 degree F.  Stir them a few times to ensure they don't scorch (I would check around 6 minutes--especially if your oven is a bit temperamental [like mine]; and stir and check again before 10 minutes [because it's amazing how fast nuts can go from 'almost done' to 'scorched'--or worse--'burnt'].  Roasting them yourself still has to be much healthier than any nuts that are cooked in oil.  Remember also, if you do roast the raw almonds in the oven, please cool them completely and then refrigerate them afterward.)"

It worked extremely well. Within 12 hours, all ants were gone. However, my latest infestation was not responding to Terro, in fact, they were eating the liquid up, but it wasn't killing the ants. My neighborhood Hardware Supply store told me that insects could become tolerant to certain pesticides. I found the ""Safer"" product, but was skeptical. Take off the spout cover and blast a fine white powder into the cracks or places where the ants are coming through. For me, it was under two long baseboards in the kitchen. Then I swept up the excess white powder into the cracks some more and cleaned the tile of any powder. It worked instantly. Any ants that even touched the powder immediately started to wiggle and die. I have a cat, so I cleaned any excess up carefully, so she cannot get any on her paws, as it is very toxic. It's as good as Boric Acid.<br /><br />This powder claims to kills Ants, Cockroaches, Earwigs, Silverfish, Crickets, Millipedes and Centipedes. I did notice that immediately after applying this product, Silverfish started to appear, evidently sensing the chemicals. Soon, they will be gone. Do check it out. I am SO glad to be rid of those ants (they even got into my freezer where I had chocolate!)."

I got a sample of the Green Mountain Hot Cocoa and thought it would be the best.  I actually threw it out.  I tried several times to drink it.  It tasted bitter and like chemicals.  I have tried samples of the other brands of hot cocoa and this by far was the worst.  I was so surprised because I adore their coffee.  I personally would not recommend this.  Maybe it is the soy I don't know.  It just tasted very, very odd.  I still would recommend their coffees though!  Just to be fair I did add chocolate redi whip.  But I add that to all of my hot cocoa and it always tastes good."

Let's just say that Omar (M&W) is on the job!<br /><br />I personally prefer Whiskas foods in pouches because Omar is OK with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge, rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container.

Marshall ""Ann S.""",0,0,5,1329523200,Tasty food for a picky cat,"Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try.

Because of some health concerns he has been drinking only decaf coffee for well over a year. He recently had problems after having a couple cups of what was supposed to be decaf at a restaurant. We believe regular coffee was brewed in what was supposed to be the decaf pot. At a recent visit to our ""local"" Starbucks, which is 90 miles away, I discovered the VIA decaf Italian Roast and bought a three pack for him to try. He likes strong, good coffee and was impressed after his first cup. He took two packages to a meeting last night so he could have coffee, too, when the rest of the group was having real coffee and drank both of them and came home wishing he had more of the VIA. I've placed a pre-order for the 50 pack available through Amazon and from now on when we travel, he will be carrying a supply of decaf Italian Roast VIA with him so he will know for sure the coffee he is drinking is decaf. It seems expensive until you look at what you would pay for a cup of mediocre coffee at any restaurant."

The one that stuck with me the most was a polling of 12 year-olds, who gave Skippy peanut butter a resounding recommendation for its tastes and texture. In writing this review, I went back and checked to see what more adult reviewers think. I'm taking the liberty of quoting from the CookingLightly website so far as its review of Creamy:<br /><br />""The roasted peanuts on the ingredient list are evident in the heady aroma and balanced flavor. Testers thought this sample was a touch oily, but spread the best...Makes the perfect peanut butter sandwich, but can turn into a savory dressing when mixed with soy, vinegar, and crushed red pepper to serve over sugar snap peas, broccoli, or a stir-fry. For a sweet version, mix with honey and mayonnaise and use as a fruit salad dressing. Mix with chile paste with garlic (sambal oelek) or sriracha for an easy sauce for roast meats.""<br /><br />This is my opinion, too, and while the above review was for the regular Creamy, it applies in my opinion to the reduced fat version just as well. I love this peanut butter. I know that Jif and Peter Pan are also often ranked highly, but Skippy is by far my preference.<br /><br />While I use it on sandwiches, I often just eat a tablespoon or two as a quick snack and source of protein. It is so good in this role that I gave it to a diabetic friend. She uses it in lieu of orange juice if she's starting to feel hypoglycemic. The peanut butter stays with her longer and has a smoother effect.<br /><br />I will note that some nutritionists are now raising questions abou he value of reduced fat peanut butter. They have two ASIC points:<br /><br />1. The process of removing fat is n fact removing monounsaturated oils which are healthy for us.<br /><br />2. To compensate for any loss of taste, manufacturers are putting back in sugars and oils which may not e so healthy.<br /><br />My rating is based on taste and texture. I'm not taking a position in nutritional debates but do suggest that you check these matters out separately if you are concerned about this kind of issue."

They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are ""meaty"" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!"

What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and ""other natural flavors"", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not ""slivered"" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased."

Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed.

These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.

Using a drip coffee maker to brew it keeps it from overheating and getting bitter.  It's healthy, too, with plenty of antioxidants in it's orange/black pekoe blend.

It has a beautiful taste, unlike their teabags, which can be very iffy.  I've had some that tasted like floor sweepings.<br /><br />This loose tea seems amazingly consistent in flavor.  I recommend it without reservation. And isn't Amazon just lovely...?  They'll bring it right to your door.  How much more could you ask?<br /><br />Earlier I mentioned an English teapot.  I favor Sadler's because of the excellent glaze, and the good material they use in the functional brown teapots they make.<br /><br />A good teapot matters.  Get yourself one, a nice tea ball, and some Lipton Loose tea and you will likely never use teabags again.  If the tea is too strong, do it the way it's done in England; keep a very lightly boiling kettle going, and dilute with boiling water to your taste."

Mellow yet intensely flavorful, this tea works very well with iced tea makers or coffee brewers.

My only gripe is I would like to see loose tea available in larger packages. Lipton used to sell it in one pound boxes, but now it's only available in 1/2 pound boxes. This six pack helps make up for the problem somewhat. We drink iced tea like some people drink their coffee: all the time!

It was, needless to say, inexpensive so I thought it was worth a taste test. One cup was Barry's Classic blend(loose), one cup Tetley (bag) and the other was Lipton (loose). Tetley's came in a distant-distant 2nd while Barry's and Lipton were tied for first. Both were very similar in body, richness and strength. A word of warning-don't ever buy cheap (in quality) loose or bagged tea. It will be stems and bits of leaves swept up from the floor-at least that is what it looks and tastes like. The tea should be just leaves as dark brown as semi sweet chocolate. All good (and some bad) tea is grown in Africa, India and Sri Lanka ( Ceylon)."

When the local groceries stopped stocking Lipton's Loose Leaf Tea. I assumed Lipton had stopped selling it because tea bags were more profitable, and people found it easier to use tea bags. WRONG, we've been sold on the idea of convenience, and taste took the back seat. This tea is packaged in a foil lined package, is fresher tasting and very consistant in quailty. Make it sweet or unsweet, it does not matter. If you make it too strong, just add water, the flavor is there!  You will be amazed as to how many GALLONS of tea you can make with one box.  You will need to brew it a few times to figure out your formula. It's worth the time!  I live in an area that has very soft water, so I don't need as much product to brew a gallon. It definitely takes more if you have hard water.<br />This is how I brew mine (this may help you get started). Using a Mr. Coffee,(12 cup) Measure 3 Tablespoons (slightly rounded) and place in the filter (just as you would coffee) Fill you crafte to the max, and brew. For sweet tea, I use One and 1/4 cup sugar per gallon. It's  easier to put the sugar in a gallon pitcher, then add the hot liquid. The sugar will dissolve completely, and you won't need as much sugar. When the sugar has dissolved, add water or ice to bring it up to a gallon. If you are not pleased with the outcome try making some adjustments. Once you figure it out. It becomes routine, and is probably one of the the most economial drinks you can make!<br />ENJOY!!<br /><br />PS I keep mine in the freezer in a ziplock, after I've opened the box."

10924,B000EM6PC6,A11ME0MQFE6CVH,JVUE05,2,3,3,1317081600,Great for Lemon Iced Tea,"Initially I purchased this in good faith for brewing it as iced tea as it is quite difficult to find loose tea leaves in stores. Here's my initial report and impressions:<br /><br />The tea leaves came loose of course but the packaging is terrible. The bag is not sealed and the flap is just folded so tea leaves came out of the bag while in transport. So a lot of your tea leaves will be inside the box which is not good. I would hope that in the future Lipton chooses a better packaging alternative to seal the bag so you don't have tea leaves all over the place.<br /><br />And as another reviewer mentioned, it is true that this particular brand has little bits and pieces of tea leaves and is not as good quality compared to other brands. And as always, you pay for what you get. I didn't expect this to be better than my Jasmine tea in a tin can which costs about $45 and taste fantastic. My goal was to buy cheap black tea leaves which are loose to make lemon iced tea which I was able to do well with that.<br /><br />Here is my lemon iced tea recipe after a lot of trial and error and taste testing:<br /><br />-1 Gallon of Lemon Iced Tea-<br /><br />1. 1 Gallon of water<br />2. 5-9 Tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea<br />3. Empty teabags<br />4. 1 cup of sugar<br />5. 1/2 cup of lemon juice<br /><br />Lipton's direction call for 2 tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea to make 1 1/2 quarts of black tea to drink. We know that 4 quarts is equal to 1 gallon, if we used 4 tablespoons of black tea we would only end up with 3 quarts of tea which is short of one gallon. If 2 tablespoons makes 1 1/2 quarts then 1 tablespoon would make about .75 of a quart. So you would need at least a minimum of 5 tablespoons or even about 5 1/4 tablespoons of tea leaves to get your 4 gallons. I would not recommend using more than 9 tablespoons as it would make the tea too strong. Some people have said that the tea is too strong for the little amount that you use to brew your tea but I would have to disagree with that. I thought the tea wasn't strong enough.<br /><br />So go ahead and boil your water till you hit the boiling point. Use between 5-9 tablespoons depending on how strong you want your tea to be and fill up those empty teabags. The directions call for brewing your tea for about 3-5 minutes. Being a tea drinker I knew that if I brew it too long that tannins would be released and make the tea bitter (yes! tannins are what make your tea bitter). If your water is too hot or you brew your tea too long the tannins will be released in the leaves making your tea bitter. Initially I only brewed my tea for about 2 minutes because I was scared that the tea would be bitter if I brewed it too long. But I found that 2 minutes time was not enough time and increased my time to about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes. That is enough time to brew the tea without releasing the tannins so Lipton's brewing time was about spot on. After you finish brewing your tea add your 1 cup of sugar and then your lemon juice. I used cane sugar and Hy-Top reconstituted lemon juice but you can use whatever brand you like or you can even use fresh squeezed lemon juice if you want. I did try Real Lemon Juice while at another supermarket but I didn't like it compared to my generic brand of lemon juice by Hy-Top.<br /><br />You probably wanted to know if I actually drank the tea without it being Lemon Iced Tea, and I did. I didn't like it nor would I recommend you drink this tea this way. I just did not feel that this tea was up to quality compared to many other brands. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other brands but I just feel that this tea wasn't up to par against other black teas nor do I recommend drinking it as just plain black tea. I particularly like the English Breakfast Black Tea by Stash better than this tea. I just felt that the quality difference was a lot but I didn't feel like buying every bag for $0.09 each every time I went to the supermarket just to brew Lemon Iced Tea. If you want to make lemon iced tea with the Stash brand you need 9 English Breakfast Black Tea bags and the same amount of sugar, lemon juice, and water. Economical wise I would get more tea buying Lipton but if taste matters I would choose another tea brand to make Lemon Iced Tea.<br /><br />I haven't tried making Raspberry Iced Tea with this yet but we'll save that for another adventure."

My mother, all her sisters, my grandmother, and all our friends considered Lipton Loose Tea to be TEA. There was no other for them.  I grew up thinking anything else was an ""off"" brand.  (Lipton Tea is America's favorite tea.)<br /><br />In the South most people make it sweet.  They add the sugar while it is hot so less sugar is required.  Now I prefer to use Splenda (SPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener Granular, 9.7-Ounce Resealable Bags (Pack of 2)) and lemon juice. This tea has a strong black-tea taste.  It is robust and pure.<br /><br />When I moved across the Mississippi River, I was shocked to discover that people in Louisiana drink their tea three times as strong as they do in Mississippi. I think one reason my people liked Lipton Loose Tea so much was that we had very little money and we had to make things go as far as possible.  It was always a good bargain.  Almost any kind of tea is an excellent bargain.<br /><br />Nutritonally it is outstanding.  It is a means of hydrating, which is considered important.  (Always hydrate responsibly:  don't drink too much! You would not want to drown.) Also it is an excellent source of flavonoids, which provide antioxidants. A glass of tea has about half as much caffeine as a cup of coffee.  Since the ingredients vary with different practices, it is difficult to estimate the amount of caffeine.<br />Some caffeine can help many people.<br /><br />On my blog, which you can find at Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook, I talked about my mother's tea and all the spread she used to make when she took food to church for dinner on the grounds.  The name of the blog entry is ""Myrtle's Stuffed Eggs.""<br /><br />About stains -- it is helpful to brush and polish your teeth immediately after enjoying this wonderful tea.  Also, you can clean glasses, pitchers, etc., with baking soda. One more tip is to drink with a straw to try to avoid getting so much of the liquid on your front teeth. (I do this, but I don't think it helps much.)<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful."

Very, very seldom do I add sugar.  And when I do, it is a very small amount.  Where I grew up, sugar in tea is an option.  However, I was stationed in the Deep South, and they drink thick sugar water with a drop of tea in it.  When my daughter was in elementary school, her teacher had the audacity to bring me a glass of that thick sugar water; I gagged.  I couldn't get past the first sip.  She might have gotten her feelings hurt.  They think you are crazy if you prefer tea with no sugar.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like fruit herbal teas."

Someone ended up picking it and brought it out to try. I wanted no part of this. While she was attempting to dole out her punishment some of it got on the kitchen table. I went to wipe it up with a rag and accidentally got a small drop on my finger. I instantly washed if off as I didn't want any of its pain to somehow seep into my skin. 30 minutes later I found out the power that this beast holds. I was talking to some people when all of a sudden it felt like someone had lit my junk on fire. This wasn't a ""when you go raw dogg with some shady club chick"" type of burning. This was more like pouring napal down my pants type of burning. Apparently water and soap are not enough to get a drop of this stuff off of your skin.

Its the other 3 hours of intense gut pain that makes a man out of you (you don't see that in the videos).

I nice strong burn for about half an hour and the small endorphin rush that follows is a good pickmeup, but, by no means recommended, I'm abit of an idiot at times and have been told in other scenarios that I have no taste buds.<br /><br />lastly, so far as I can figure one drop of this in 8 fluid ounces of liquid will raise it about 300 scovilles. so I assumed 4 drops in a cup of hot chocolate would give me about half a jalapeno. well, I could hardly taste the chocolate and my stomach threatened to chew it's way out alien style.<br /><br />and I just reminded myself that I got some sauce on my finger nearly 5 hours ago because after all that time and various hand washings my eye still burned after scratching it.<br /><br />sorry if that's a little long, but I wanted to add more input to this highly underrated product.<br /><br />and very lastly. if indeed the dropper releases 50 microliters at a time (the best description of the measurement of a drop I could find) then there are well over a thousand drops in this bottle. though I'm not that great at math, so you don't have to take my word for the numbers I give here.<br /><br />happy eating,<br />  Daniel"

Immediately you have the flavor, which isn't too bad to be honest.  Kind of a dark, smoky, pepper fruit flavor.  Then the heat shows up and keeps building from a tinge until your mouth feels like its glowing.  Maybe its because I wasn't an idiot who took a spoonful of the stuff, but there was no 30 minute burn.  The real burn lasted 5, *maybe* 10 minutes.  The gut bomb that everyone talks about?  Nonexistent.  And I am not one of these people who claim to eat habaneros plain on their own, because I don't.  Personally I have to call BS on the people that say that.  Its a bit expensive for a 2 oz bottle, but when all it takes to give something a pleasant heat is a drop or two without changing flavor, its worth the price.

Its a very special yearly treat for me, so I expect a lot from the product.<br /><br />Pros for Scott's Cakes version:  Good organization and logistics:  the package arrived quickly, the candy was well wrapped in the shipping box and shrink-wrapped in a box of its own.  Candy was in good condition (i.e., no broken pieces) and fresh.<br /><br />This seller's peppermint bark achieves a nice mix of peppermint and white chocolate flavor.  White chocolate gives off a nice mellow tone; it is good quality.  There is no dark chocolate layer to upset the balance of peppermint and white chocolate flavors in one's mouth.  This attracted me to Scott's Cakes.<br /><br />Cons:  The quality of the peppermint pieces in the chocolate was very disappointing.  The ad mentions that the buyer should expect to see pieces of candy cane/peppermint starlight mints mixed with white chocolate.  The photo seems to support this claim, showing robustly sized pieces of candy cane in the bark.  I expected a very crunchy chewing experience, which I think is the hallmark of the best types of peppermint bark.  However, the pieces of peppermint candy are in reality very small; there is no sensation of crispness when taking a bite.  The peppermint candy has a chewy consistency, making it seem more like taffy.  Thus, there is no auditory pleasure in consuming this version of peppermint bark."

A blend of 80% Yukon Blend, an array of Latin American and Indonesian coffees; and, 20% Italian Roast - a blend of Latin American coffees.<br /><br />In the cup the flavor was weak, bold as it smelled it did not seem to have the same score in taste. Light bodyweight with a woody feel to it. The light acidity is topped off with a fruity overtone and bittersweetness.<br /><br />Let me be as bold as to recommend Peet's Arabian Mocha-Java.

I just like to try anything which looks interesting to me and this caffe Verona is one of the better speciality blends Starbucks has offered.<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention, whole beans always rule .

In fact, they should probably call it `Extremely Bold'...or maybe even `Ridiculously Bold.'  The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water.  The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.  The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar.  With enough cream and sugar, French Roast is pretty good; but I wouldn't recommend this particular Starbucks variety if you like your coffee black...unless you wanna stay awake for a week."

Here they are:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL, COCONUT OIL, LACTOSE, WHEY, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (INCLUDING BARLEY PROTEIN), NON-FAT MILK, BUTTERMILK SOLIDS, SODIUM CASEINATE, SOY LECITHIN-AN EMULSIFIER, SALT, ARTIFICIAL COLORS (YELLOW 5 LAKE, YELLOW 6 LAKE, BLUE 2 LAKE)<br /><br />Now I must admit that I didn't look at the label either.  I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust.  Apparently not.<br /><br />So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were.  I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones.  I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted.  I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack.  Very waxy on the tongue.  Not nice like good chocolate would be.  So I tried the butterscotch ones.  Where the heck was the flavor?<br /><br />Well I was shocked when I read the label.  I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk.  And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things.  Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them.<br /><br />In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags.  If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good.  Really sweet more than flavorful, and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/brownie baker"

Five stars because it's a decent price and I trust this product for being extra virgin more than other name brands.<br />This oil is from Italy, which means this oil is milled in October or November or December, as with all northern hemisphere olive oils.

No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good.  No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells.  No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture.

According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well.<br /><br />That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff.  You're probably wondering what the catch is, right?  It definitely isn't the taste.  As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good.  I only see two drawbacks.<br />1) Cost.  Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected.<br />2) Quantity.  The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies.<br /><br />16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them.  However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us.  I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag.  Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating.  Even so, I still wish there were more in a package.<br /><br />One last note, just because I found it to be unusual.  Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight.  These aren't.  Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others.  There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space.  It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me."

Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.

I had tried a few other weird/bland gluten free options and wow- these cookies really surprised me - the are actually very good! Crispy, no weird/off tastes, just like a ""real"" cookie. Nice size for dunking in a cold cup of lactose free milk without getting lost or soggy. I deducted one star because they could use a few more chips sprinkled in there.<br /><br />They are a little expensive but I don't mind the price point considering that the factory goes to great lengths to protect against cross contamination from allergens and gluten.

They say gluten free, and I totally believe they are, because I did not have a wheat-type reaction. But, I have to say, I always feel MISERABLE after eating these cookies.<br />Someone else mentions how they are too sweet, etc etc. I don't think they taste too sweet, and they have 13g of sugar per serving which doesn't seem like it's that much, considering most other 'sweets' have more sugars per serving (take a look at Gatorade, for example).<br />That said, it does seem to be some kind of a reaction to the sugar, because immediately after eating them I feel like my body is dumping into some kind of sugar coma. I start to feel like lead, and lightheaded. They also mess up my tummy. Maybe it's the type of sugar they use? Evaporated cane juice is the 1st ingredient, and they also contain 2 kinds of cellulose, which I think are sugars also (but I could be wrong).<br />Anyhow, I gave 4 stars for taste, because they are THAT good, but keep in mind you may feel like you need a lengthy nap to recover from eating them.<br /><br />I agree with the previous poster they should do *something* about this ... I don't want stevia or artificial sweeteners in them, but maybe try using less sugar, or a different kind of sugar, like organic brown? I have no idea, but I would never let a kid eat more than 1 of these at a time, for fear it'd make them just pass out!<br />I eat other sweet stuff, and nothing makes me feel this bizarrely over-sugared.<br /><br />I'm not even totally sure it's the sugar that makes you feel this way ... any ideas?

The milk-free chips are great:  nicely rounded flavor, not burnt or sharp.  The texture is pleasantly crisp & sandy; not tough, not hard, not chewy.  Great with coffee or tea.

I finished my first two boxes (I had bought, as a test, one of the 16 pack boxes in Cinnamon and one in Sugar) and sadly after a month or so I had eaten them all. I tried baking something simliar and couldn't do it -- though when I have mroe time, I'll give it many more tries.

That is not the case with these cookies.  They are by far the best allergy-friendly cookies that we have tried yet!  They have a nice, crisp (but not hard) cookie texture.  I was also impressed with the shelf-life on the cookies that we tried.

I paid a visit to my local Starbucks to pick up a 1.25 oz. pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package.  The smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off.  The bag had a synthetic odd smell inside.  I took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness-a good thing about the cookie- but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste.  It almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor. A very odd and unpalatable taste indeed. I was so disappointed.  I really liked the story of Dr. Lucy and the idea of the cookie, but most definitely did NOT like the cookie. Although I would classify myself as a bit of a food snob with high standards, I put that aside when reviewing this cookie.  I do not think even the less discerning customer would enjoy this cookie."

11218,B001KVPC0G,A2OL5WLCNZVD9K,nonpareil,3,3,5,1320192000,Perfect little guys,"Yup, no stray pieces, just whole brown almonds. Which is to say that these are not ""blanched"" - blanching being the process that removes the actual skin of the almond (not the husk) and leaves a pale buff-colored product. And the description of ""lightly salted"" is accurate. I can barely taste it. The can says the ingredients are almonds, vegetable oil (canola, safflower and/or sunflower) and salt. That's it. Gluten-free. Interestingly enough, there is no indication on either the can or their website whether these are raw or roasted. And I couldn't tell by eating them. But Blue Diamond responded to my email query, saying they are in fact oil roasted - have to be ""Pasteurized"", per a new California law. [You might want to know that this is a ""light"" roasting. I would say that it goes part way to a roasted flavor, remaining as healthy as possible while conforming to the legislation I mentioned. My taste preference is actually for the flavor of a fully roasted almond, bad me.]<br /><br />They taste fresh and almondy, as they should. They make a wonderful addition in both taste and appearance, to my just-created Nonpareil Trail Mix which is lo-carb and gluten-free as I am trying even harder to follow this kind of diet. I'm pleased to report that these Blue Diamond Almonds are properly dated: on the bottom of the can it says ""BEST BEFORE JUL 20 14"". That gives plenty of time to use up six little cans.<br /><br />And about the cans, they seem to be metal bottom and sides, making them superior for storage although the plastic replaceable top with sealed metallic foil under it might be breachable by the ubiquitous rodent. The little cans are nicely reusable."

This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 2% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you. This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them."

I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.

11245,B001KVPC0G,AI0BCEWRE04G0,Stoney,0,3,5,1337644800,Delicious,"DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are ""heart healthy"" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.<br />> Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.<br />> I have not tried the ""lightly salted"" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.<br /><br />CANS vs BAGS<br />Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1/4"" in diameter by 2 3/8"" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don't stay ""openned"" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don't get much of a price break for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted-in-oil flavor.<br /><br />LESS ROASTED ALMONDS<br />If you prefer less-roasted almonds, roasted without added oil, consider <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COJ85G"">Back To Nature California Almonds, Sea Salt Roasted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />UNROASTED ALMONDS<br />Unroasted almonds are available <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COE1AI"">Back To Nature California Almonds, Unroasted & Unsalted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> but beware that thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.  Unroasted almonds are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.  While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds, (which have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods).  Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer.  Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw.  7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child.  Moreover, a child raised on raw almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) are safe to eat---they are NOT.  The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds."

I found a little coffee shop on the Grand Canal. I knew that moment with its aromas and sights would be locked into my spirit as a rite of passage in a sense. Unfortunately back in the states I discovered another world. Most of the coffees here tasted like something that was scraped off the pavement at Jiffy Lube. Eventually, after much research I found a couple of great brands, bought my own espresso machine and we lived happily ever after.<br /><br />One day I read an article on Weaver's. It sounded good. Since I'm a happy member of Amazon Prime, I decided to give it a try. It is amazing. Even the subtle caramel flavor and scent is rich and soothing.

I can't drink any other coffee now because all the others taste terrible compared to Weavers. Try this...grab a handful of whatever whole been coffee you drink in one hand.  Hold a handful of Weaver's whole been coffee in the other.  Look at the size of the beans.  Now notice the texture and smell of the  beans.  You don't even have to taste them to see that it is a high quality product.<br /><br />I used to order this coffee directly from Weaver's website until I found it here on Amazon.  I was worried that it would not be as fresh as the coffee ordered directly from Weavers but Amazon sells so much of it, that it never sits around for long before being shipped out. It also arrives much faster via Amazon.<br /><br />I can't think of anything bad to say about it.  It is a little more expensive than standard coffee but not much.

But, I don't get that sort of taste from the Matcha and that's a good thing, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />The matcha does taste a little different with the banana flavoring.  The normal vegetative tones of the matcha meld with the flavor of the banana ... the fruity notes of the banana ... in such a way that the vegetal notes seem to disappear and become more fruity.

Error?","I made prunes a permanent part of my diet because (a) they are promoted as the best food source of antioxidants, and (b) because they're very sweet and serve as a good sugar substitute for when you have sugar cravings. They're also supposed to be good, um, um, against constipation, so be careful. I usually eat a couple at a time, and never more than four; never a problem within these limits. They're nice to add to oatmeal too, along with bananas and raisins (or instead of raisins). Raisins are also a good antioxidant, in fact, second best after prunes, about half as strong.<br /><br />I've tried many kinds of prunes and so far Sunsweet are the best: I like their taste best; consistency is good (neither too mushy nor dried up like cardboard); they keep up well (I do keep thim in the fridge, but that's strictlyl speaking, unnecessary -- they'll be fine for a couple of weeks in the open, and they taste better at room temperature), and the product quality is consistent, no surprises.<br /><br />I buy them in stores, where an 18 oz canister usually costs between four and five bucks. This page wants thirty? Well, this must be some sort of error... I expect an online price to be better, not six-to-seven times what I can get locally. So, my bottomline is: this sort of prunes is very good, but pick them up at your local grocery store, not here. In fact, I got them a few times on sale for like two-seventy a piece, in a local drugstore, believe it or not. Be very careful with prices here: first, they jump around quite a bit; and second, if you subscribe, and the price goes up, they'll just go ahead and charge you more w/o bothering to ask you if you agree to pay more. Avoid subscriptions 'cause, yeah, they'll give you an extra 15% discount -- and  next month will jack up the price by 50%. It's a racket, so stay clear.<br /><br />PS. Just discovered: Trader Joe's carries pitted prunes too: a resealable plastic bag holds one pound (16 oz) and costs two-eighty-nine. That's about one tenth of what this guy above wants.

Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me!

No vinegar.  Only slightly salty.  With a mild nutty flavor.  To me, they most closely resemble ripe black olives---but milder.<br /><br />If you like olives but are on a low-salt diet, and perhaps mostly use them in salads, or even sliced on pizza, Lindsay Olives are terrific, as is the price.  For a delicious spread, microwave cream cheese for about 1 minute in a ~24 oz glass bowl (such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MZPII"">Marinex 23.7-Ounce Small Round Casserole with Lid</a>) to soften it, then mix-in coarsely chopped Lindsay Green Ripe olives.  To make a dip, add a tablespoon of milk and mix.<br /><br />For snacking, or as a light meal with cheese and fruit, Lindsay Pitted Ripe Green Olvies are a faint shadow of the truly wonderful genre of ""California ripe green olives"".  Unfortunately, the only brand you are likely to find outside California is Grabers olives,<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P8HPCI"">Graber Olives Size 14 7.5 oz. Can</a>.  Grabers are the Rolls Royce of ripe green olives, and are priced accordingly. About $1.50 per olive including shipping to the East Coast, perhaps $1 per olive if you buy them by the case directly from Grabers.  What's the difference?  Bigger, better olives to begin with, PITS, and careful processing.  The pits make a huge difference in any olive---they impart a nutty flavor to the flesh.  In the case of Grabers, the flaver is nutty and buttery. If you want to impress your guests at a buffet, serve Grabers---and go for the big size 16 olives.  They'll cost you about $2 each (i.e., per olive), but are worth it.  Unfortunately, Lindsay does not sell unpitted olives.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAKUP0"">Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Bag</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAIR46"">Byzantine Pitted Country Olive Mix, 5-Pound Bag</a> Both are nice mixes of unpitted olives, without hot-peppers or other excessive flavoring."

I seriously surround myself with anything rosy!<br /><br />So when I saw this, *rose preserves*, literally preserves made with real rose petals, I couldn't wait to try it. Oh, the wait was incredible! When it finally arrived I didn't even wait for the toaster, I grabbed a spoon and dug right in!<br /><br />It's delicious. Divine. Extraordinary. It feels absolutely indulgent, eating a jam made of roses. It's so romantic and positively Victorian. There couldn't be a daintier dollop for your scones at tea time.<br /><br />So far I've had rose preserves on waffles, toast, ice cream, fresh fruit & yogurt, and coffee cake. I daresay it would even make a unique sweetener for hot tea.<br /><br />Speaking of sweet, that is my one issue. I find these preserves to be really much sweeter than I generally like; I prefer a bit more tartness, even in jams. Don't get me wrong: it's not overpoweringly sweet, there *is* a definite rose flavor in this, and definitely real petals adding unique flavor and texture. I just wish it weren't quite so sweet. But apparently, according to another reviewer who has tried other brands, Kafkas Rose Preserves are the *least* sugary! Any bit sweeter and it would definitely overpower the delicate rose flavor.<br /><br />So, while I can't give it a full 5 stars because I think it's too sweet -  and by the way I sure wish I could only deduct a half star -  I acknowledge that Kafkas Rose Preserves might be the best available. I certainly won't stop putting it on everything and yes, occasionally enjoying a tiny spoonful!<br /><br />I'm going to host a little tea party for my two little nieces and our American Girls dolls (My <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010XH10I"">American Girl Samantha Doll & Paperback Book</a>, Joelle's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZHY3H4"">American Girl Julie Doll and Paperback Book</a>, and Lisey's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZYZAO"">American Girl Kit Kittredge Doll & Paperback Book</a>) and I know the girls will get a kick out of eating jam made of flower petals! I'm also looking forward to my extended family's next brunch, because I will be proudly serving up some rose preserves. In fact, I may be giving out Kafkas Rose Preserves as hostess gifts in lieu of the boring bottles of moscato or prosecco I'm forever dragging to parties. This would be promptly opened and enjoyed, I'm sure of it!<br /><br />If you're a rose lover, or looking for a unique gift, perhaps a cute and clever new spin on ""a bouquet of roses and a box of candy"", I highly recommend these rose preserves!"

In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.

Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.<br /><br />The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.

The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it.

When I do have a steak, though, I absolutely love the taste of A1, which brings out the best in any cut of meat. Although I am not too enthusiastic about putting it on seafood (which the label suggests as a good idea), I think it goes well with any kind of beef, and works well on chicken and turkey as well. It is an essential ingredient in many marinades, and is generally one of the most used items for meat preparation in my refrigerator.<br /><br />What many people don't realize is the long and noble history of A1, which dates to 1824. In 1824, when a king's palate reigned supreme, Henderson William Brand, chef to England's King George IV, created a sauce for King George for use on meats. King George was so impressed with it that he proclaimed it ""A1,"" and that's how the sauce got its name.<br /><br />Beyond the history lesson, though, I think King George was correct in his gustatory proclamation: this sauce really is ""A1""!"

It's also good on tenderloin, ribeye, or filet mignon,  but if the meat is top quality, you want to taste the meat, not the sauce.<br /><br />A1 is very good on hamburgers when you want a little zip.

Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.<br /><br />I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.<br /><br />Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!<br /><br />Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again. Please keep up the good job, great service and outstanding roses you have."

I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.<br /><br />Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed.

As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me!

It is tasty, healthful, fresh, and lovingly produced by hand in small batches and according to ages-old methods and principles.<br /><br />I began using this ghee as a part of a transition to eating more healthy, home-cooked foods. More recently, I participated in an Ayurvedic cleanse that required that I take 1/4 cup of plain, warm ghee for several mornings straight! Though this can be an unpleasant experience with ghee of lower quality, the Pure Indian Foods ghee was truly delicious. The flavor is clean and sweet, without any of the harshness or overbearing unctuousness of other ghees (even those labelled as organic). And not a hint of rancidity, to which I'm very sensitive.<br /><br />Only unhomogenized milk is used for this ghee, which is unusual and extremely beneficial.

It might be worth it if I was primarily using this at room temperature like on bread, but I usually use regular butter for that, and for cooking you really cannot tell any difference in flavor.

Ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement (albeit, one that tastes really good). Ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion, but it can be a healthy addition to any diet.<br /><br />Some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol.<br /><br />I performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available. I compared quality and value. Ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed -- especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used.<br /><br />The ghee comparison table can be found at this blog: [see link in comment]<br /><br />When I started this ghee comparison, I was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products. However, I learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards. It was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available. It is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on Amazon.com. (Grass Fed Organic ghee is one of those top picks.)<br /><br />Because such high quality ghees are available, I focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. Some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. The information in the table (link above) reflects that fact.<br /><br />The focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking. It was optimum health. Therefore, I was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest.<br /><br />I rank Grass Fed Organic ghee as one of the very best products. Grass Fed Organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions (such as phase of the moon, chanting, etc.). It is a great quality, great tasting product. And the good price makes it a great value. I highly recommend this ghee."

That last part is important -- that means that this ghee has high amounts of K2 compared to other ghees. K2 is the great bone and teeth-building nutrient; it helps the body deposit calcium appropriately. K2 cannot be gotten from green leafy vegetables -- it can only be gotten from animal fats, organ meats, or some kinds of fermented vegetables.<br /><br />Also, apparently this ghee has tested as high in K2 as the very expensive ""butter oil"" that I used to buy.<br /><br />Finally, I've seen an improvement in my kids' teeth since I've been giving them several spoonfuls of ghee each day.

I purchased the ghee because I observed a cavity starting..and wanted to fix it without going to the denist & using harmful drugs.  Since I have been following a few simple suggestions in this book, the tooth enamel is rebuilding.  This book also contains other recipes and foods that can help cure and prevent cavities.<br /><br />Getting back to the ghee.  When I visited Pure Foods website, I was very pleased that they had several kinds of ghee including the regular.  For example, they have digestive ghee..which includes spices (helpful for digestion) some of which are also traditionally used to make chai tea. I love this digestive ghee because I can make regular black tea and add the digestive ghee & a little sweetner and it makes a nice chai tea.  It warms me up during the cold and dampness and another added benefit..my stools come out much smoother..and constipation is usually eiliminated completely when I use it consistently. They also have ghees for recipes with chicken, fish and stake.  I've used these other ghees in a few receipes for chicken soup, on salmon and of course, lamb stew..I enjoy it very much.  Yes, they are sold separately from the regular ghee. Oh, they also have very small sample sizes to try before purchasing a large size."

It is essential for those who follow a GAPS diet, Wise Tradition, or other 'healthy fat' lifestyle. If not, no matter. Pure Ghee tastes great on toast, popcorn and ANY Indian/Indonesian recipe and great for traveling/camping/pack-backing because it doesn't require refrigeration.

He claims regular use of high vitamin butter oil from grass fed cows feeding on fast growing summer grass not only adds much needed vitamin A to the diet, but also adds something he calls the ""Activator X Factor"" or something like that, which is supposed to cause your body to remineralize your teeth. Nagel recommends a $40 jar of the oil, but this ghee seems just as good. It's organic, high in fat soluble vitamin A, and delicious. It's also from cows fed on that fast growing grass, and it has the warm yellow coloring to prove its vitamin content. It feels good to eat.

I used to use the Purity Farms brand Organic Ghee, but find that this one has a much better flavor and texture.  I think this is due to it being pasture fed and non-homogenized which is probably not true for the other product.  It is a bit more expensive, but the benefits of grass fed cannot be overstated when it comes to Ghee.  The only other Ghee I would recommend is Ancient Organics which is also prepared in the traditional way, but it is a bit more expensive than this brand.  Ghee is also one of the only oils I would recommend using for cooking as it does not change its composition when heated.  A little every day can make a big difference in health over time."

However, several bags did not pop correctly (or at all) and had to be thrown out.  Also, many other bags would have a burnt hole after popping.  I realize that some of this variability could be due to microwave wattage, but it was only bags from this large box of Orville Redenbacher's that would do this.  I think when you order such a large box, your chances of getting ""dud"" bags increase...just something to keep in mind!  Is it worth it to buy in bulk when more of the bags will be duds?"

(You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' ""spins"" on this). Good books to get in this regard are ""Foods Pets Die For"" and ""Protect Your Pet"":<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165562"">Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165422"">Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</a><br /><br />My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive ""premium brands""). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.<br /><br />I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.<br /><br />I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are ""Made in the USA"", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!<br /><br />But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can't get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don't overeat! And after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.<br /><br />Oh, and hi, Ellen - and many thanks!"

My cats, however, weren't as impressed as I was and turned their noses up at their new food. They did eat it, but clearly weren't enthused.<br />Although I like the human grade ingredients used in Halo foods, I do wish they used more meat sources. There are only a couple protein sources in the food and as a result the protein content of Spot's Stew, around 30%, is also a little lower than what I'd like.<br />Overall, however, this is definitely a great food to feed your pets, though if you have a cat that's a finicky eater or that needs a high protein food, Halo Spot's Stew may not be for you."

The Keurig would sit right on top and take up less room. What more could I ask for? Then when I brought it home though the truth came out.<br /><br />The draw is very well made and works perfect. However you are adding about 3 inches to the size of the keurig. Due to the height of my cabinets, it raised the machine just enough to not longer be able to open enough because the handle hits the cabinet. For a few days I was pulling it out and using it like that, but that got too annoying. Instead I now use the draw, but not with my coffee maker on it. It now holds my knife block instead, since those can still come out just fine.<br /><br />If your keurig is set up with no cabinet above it, this option is beyond perfect.

I read the product specs, ESPECIALLY THE DIMENSIONS...<br />I measured the space I have, and armed with that knowledge, I ordered the item.<br /><br />The item is exactly as described and pictured... and because I pre-measured, I KNEW it would fit (unlike other reviewers who apparently couldn't be bothered, and then give it a low-rating as a result).<br /><br />It's a simple design, and well built.  It's sturdy enough to hold the weight of my LARGE Cuisinart k-cup brewer, with a full reservoir.  It's a solid wire-frame build, and the rails the drawer runs on are part of that wire-design.  The mesh walls are a tad light-weight, but they aren't load-bearing, and are only meant for aesthetics and to contain the k-cups. (I also store Splenda packets in one column of mine.)<br /><br />Other than my 'normal' blend, I tend to have up to 5 additional flavors for a weekend treat, or just to mix it up on occasion... keeping these loose on the counter, or bouncing around mixed up in a box made it a pain to pick through them... but now I keep them in line in the segmented rows in the drawer.  Having a lack of storage space in my cupboards and kitchen drawers makes this the natural and ideal choice.<br /><br />Many have been disappointed that it didn't ""fit"" -- but all you need to do is measure your brewer's footprint, and it's height beneath your cupboards (if applicable).<br /><br />It's not a PERFECT item (the mesh could be a tad better grade, or the price about $5 lower) but otherwise highly recommended purchase."

I wrote them and told them I was going to return the item and buy it where I had seen it for much cheaper and they just didn't care.  When I asked how much my refund was going to be they told me approximately $3.00 more than what they had credited me for.  I don't like to be deceived and I thought you get the best prices with Amazon, but that is not true at all.  Keep checking other places before you purchase from Amazon and there Customer Service stinks in my opinion.  Furthermore, I received my item from the other place and I love it!"
11803,B004P4TL8E,A1B2HCS03AC5DT,Mary P.,202,219,4,1299715200,"This is not necessarily a ""space saver""","So, I bought the Coffee Pod Drawer thinking it was the answer to my cluttered coffee area on my kitchen counter.  Not exactly.  First and foremost, let me say - this is a great product.  It does hold the pods neatly.  It has a nice, durable, slip resistant top that lets you feel comfortable that your Keurig won't slip or tip over. This is why I gave the product 4 stars.<br />My issue is this:  I purchased this simply because I thought it would use up less space on my counter if my K-Cups were stored inside this drawer and underneath my Keurig, as opposed to my (somewhat) bulky K-Cup Carousel.  (Which by the way, is chrome, and I really despise chrome.)  Anyways, what I did not consider was the fact that it raises your Keurig up by about 3.25 inches.  Before I bought this drawer, my Keurig had just enough space on the counter under the cupboard that it sits under, for me to lift the top of the Keurig open to put new K-Cups in, and to fill the water, etc.  That additional 3.25 inches really makes a difference.  I can no longer open the top of the Keurig all the way without banging the cupboard.  We all know that you don't NEED to open it all of the way, but when that's what you were used to doing, well, you can understand...  I pretty much bang the cupboard every day now.  Another drawback to the idea of purchasing this soley to save space, is that you can't keep anything in front of the drawer, since obviously, you need to open the drawer to get the K-Cups out. I used to keep the coffee condiments in front of my Keurig, and now I can't.<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: This is a great product in the sense that it gets the carousel (if you have one) off your counters.  But, I would only buy this if 1.) You have ample clearance above your Keurig now to be able to still lift the top open once you set this up, and 2.) You don't need to use the space in front of the drawer.<br /><br />Happy Coffee Drinking!<br /><br />Update:  02/20/12:<br />Almost a year later - I am still using the Storage Drawer.  Yes, from time to time I forget and still whack the cupboard, but the Keurig and the cupboard are no worse for the wear.  I still keep my eye out for better storage solutions, and none have really looked like they would be any better.  While the product is well made and has been durable (still looking practically new, and is heavily used in my kitchen) - I still think it's a bit pricey for what it is.  I just checked online and it still ranges from $25 to $45.

Distaso,5,5,3,1306108800,Was expecting better quality for the price but love the storage!,"First off I very much prefer this look to the rotating holders, plus it holds MORE K cups than they do.  I also like that it takes up less storage space than those carousels plus a machine.  I have limited counter top space and it is already crowded.<br />A minor issue, as I had read before, was that the added height to the machine causes lid to hit the cupboards while opening and closing. I am OK with pulling it away from the wall a bit and will eventually place my machine in a more open counter space to avoid this.  It does bother my husband more though.<br />I was disappointed with the product a bit.  My main problem was the material on the top of the drawer, that you rest the machine on, was not done very aesthetically.  AS soon as I opened what stood out to me was that it had to have been hand cut, and was cut slightly wrong on my product.  First I can still see the pencil mark all across the front.  Then it was cut too short and  coroner was not cut squarely.  It happens to h ave also been across the front edge of my product so it just sticks out to me and lessens it's appeal.<br />I find the drawer to operate smoothly and easily.  you can not reach the back row of K-cups while full but that is not a big deal to me at all."

Not very tidy and a little inconvenient, but the best I could do. I was thrilled to find this holder at the store (where it cost about $25 - beware some of these Amazon seller prices!) and bought it immediately. It's perfect! It holds 36 K-cups at a time, so I can stock it and put the K-cups away in the closet for a few weeks until I start running low. It also complements my black and silver brewer nicely. It's very stable and has a no-slip top so you don't have to worry about your Keurig tipping over. It does add about 4 inches of height, so make sure you have enough clearance if your brewer is under a cupboard. Highly recommended."

It's pretty clunky to pull open and even harder to close.<br />It doesn't pull out far enough to reach the back of the drawer, so you have to tip the final K-Cup out, which is hard if you have an entire coffee maker on top.<br />Again, all mesh, so the cups don't sit smoothly in the tray, and the sections are a hair too narrow so the cups brush one another awkwardly.<br />My upper cabinets are raised higher than average because we are both tall, and this still didn't leave us enough room to open the maker while on the drawer.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />For our modern kitchen, it's nice to look at.<br />It comfortable fits my Capresso FrothPro on one side and two 64oz Ghirardelli bottles (front to back) on the other so it still saves us counter space.<br />When I tried my Keurig on it, I expected some buckling but it seemed to stand firm even with a full water tank.<br /><br />All in all, for $25 it's a lot nicer to look at than the spinning barrel style holders, and I don't need my coffee to be on display.  Plus it looks easy to clean which for me is a plus."

I read over many reviews to decide whether to buy the carousel or this storage drawer. I finally decided on this for the space saving design. It was the right choice. It is sturdy, durable and somewhat attractive. It slides out smooth and quiet, and holds a nice amount of cups. It pulls out far enough so you can see the cups far in the back of the drawer. I am hoping that they will make one that has 2 drawers, one on top of the other, so I could store more cups at a time.

I didn't want to spend the extra few dollars for this drawer type.<br />After shifting that one around from drawer to balanced against the wall I finally gave in and went for this great holder that allows the Keurig to sit on top and now I have my counter space back and a nice neat area for my<br />Keurig.

I expected to get a product similar to what I have seen in the stores, but this obviously is a replica. The sliders on the bottom of the tray that are supposed to keep the tray straight when you slide it in and out broke off before I even got it out of the package. It is not something you can fix unless you have a solder gun. Even then, it is very ""sticky"" pulling the tray out because there are no rollers. It is metal on metal, which does not work well without some sort of lubrication. I love Amazon, but this product is inferior at best."

First, this does not fit under my Keurig properly, my lid to the Keurig will not open all the way if this sits UNDER the machine.  This is a quality piece-it does not feel flimsy or a crappy build.  The drawer works smooth with no problems.  The K-Cups fit perfectly!  The reason I love it is I had my husband drill a few holes and mounted it under my counter (in the corner where the cupboards meet).  (I uploaded two pictures under images for you to see what I mean).  This works GREAT as an under the counter holder.  I warn you, measure your cupboards first, some of my cupboards were not deep enough to install this as an ""under counter"" product.  However, the ""corner"" where my cupboards meet worked super.  I love that it's ""off"" my counter but it actuallly looks nice and keeps all the cups in a space that is easy to use and does not take up precious counter space in my small kitchen!"

I hated wasting a whole drawer with my various K-cup boxes (tea, cider, coffees, etc).  I thought about the carousels, but didn't like the idea of having it on my counter.  I wanted something that was more: 1) discreet; and 2) space saving.<br /><br />1) More discreet: Yes!<br />It looks nice and you can't even tell what is in it.<br /><br />2) Space saving: Yes!<br />My Keurig B60 fits perfectly on it.<br /><br />I hate having cluttered looking counter tops.  This drawer allows me to store my cups neatly, in a unit that looks nice.  I also love how it has dividers for each row to allow you to organize your K-cups.  You cna slo pull the drawer out pretty far, so that you can see all of your k-cups.  I also LOVE that I get my drawer (where my k-cups were previously stored) back!<br /><br />I do wish that the top of it looked a little nicer. The black, spongy material on the top looks a little cheap. Because most of it is covered with the Keurig, you don't really see much of it anyway, so it isn't a big deal at all.  But, the material is a bit on the cheaper side - still nice though!<br /><br />Additional Notes - Things that were mentioned by previous posters already, but that bear repeating:<br /><br />1) Beware: With your keurig on top of it, you may not be able to open the top.<br />I wasn't thinking (and failed to read one of the reviews that mentioned this) and got this without realizing this.  Duh!  Sure enough, I can't open the top with my keurig on the drawer.  Ooops.  No biggie though - someone commented with a great idea: Put felt on the bottom of the drawer so that you can easily slide the entire unit out when you need to use your keuirg. I plan to do this.<br /><br />2) It is MUCH cheaper elsewhere.<br />At the time of this review, it is listed on Amazon for almost $50.

I couldn't find the drawer - it was sold out everywhere I looked for a month.  I finally found it on Amazon, and at a good price.  The drawer has lived up to my expectations.  I keep my Keurig in an area where there are no upper cabinets, so I don't have trouble with it being higher now.  I also alternate K-cups facing up and down so I can get more in the drawer.

Received the item in 2 days (Prime really rocks, doesn't it?) and am so happy; we can finally get rid of our K-cup carousel.<br /><br />This drawer holds more K-cups and keeps them out of sight, freeing countertop real estate. It glides open smoothly and seems very well made. It was shipped in a nice sturdy box and arrived in excellent condition. The drawer has 6 divided sections, each of which holds 6 K-cups. Perfect for us, since we like variety! The drawer doesn't pull completely out, but has a built-in stop; it doesn't seem to make it harder to get the last K-cup out, at least for me. I'm a female with average lady-fingers. YMMV. Still, I like the stop, I wouldn't want to have K-cups rolling all over the kitchen floor.<br /><br />Note - if you keep your machine under upper cabinets, you'll likely need to pull it out away from the wall to allow enough clearance to insert K-cups and fill the reservoir. We just turned our unused kitchen desktop (it's counter is 3-4"" lower) into a coffee station.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Amazon doesn't carry the T-disc version of this drawer, so tomorrow it's back to the store to buy one of those.

This flavor is not always available as it is a limited edition flavor, but fear not, these cookies do very well when frozen and can go directly from the freezer to the microwave for about 40 seconds, and you have a nice chewy delicious cookie.<br /><br />This flavor is delicious-some of the major ingredients are whole grain rolled oats, raisins, dried apples, walnuts, coconut and spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and carrot cake spices).  The cookie comes in at 310 calories, 18% fiber, with 17g of sugar and 15% iron.<br /><br />I was doubtful that a large cookie would sustain me, as lunch for me is about 5.5 hours away, but I have no problem, this cookie is filling and delicious.

Kind of fruity, but very good.<br />I think these are perfect for mornings where I don't have time for breakfast and want something I can grab and eat while driving or once I'm at the office."

The natural ingredient list is what caught my attention. We have enough food products on the market that are over-processed and contain so many artificial things that most people can't even pronounce. I ordered the Morning Glory variety in a trio pack  which also contained the Oatmeal Raisin and the Fruit and Nut varieties.  Since I had tried the chocolate cookie but was not aware of the other choices, I started combing the internet in an attempt to mass-order these cookies.  After seeing the huge variety of cookies available directly from the product maker, I took a chance on looking at Amazon to compare prices.  Bingo, Amazon won, since the value of the cookies came to a couple of cents more than $1.00 per cookie, I had to place an order.  Everyone who has tasted these cookies have fallen in love with them.  I highly recommend them to anyone who is looking a wholesome, natural snack that you can feel good about eating or serving to guests."

I have ordered them three times now and each time they have been soft, tasty, and easily slide out of the bags. I sincerely think you got a bum pack.

A great service I wish this company would do again...<br />Anyway, there was one lady entrepreneur, whose product happened to be a healthy breakfast cookie such as this....<br />I think perhaps it could have been Erin Baker, I could not verify this.<br />I know at the time, I purchased several quantities of this lady's cookies (do not remember the variety) and was VERY pleased with them :)<br />Then, the product was no longer available :(  I was able to get them for awhile at retail store about 25 miles from me and they were costlier than on TV, so stopped purchasing them.<br />Time went by, and my husband requested an item like this to pack in his lunch box for work as well as my teenage son requesting the same for before school in the mornings.<br />After Googling breakfast cookie with thought of making them myself from a recipe, I found Erin Baker on AMAZON and it was like finding an old friend :)<br />Still have not made at home my own cookies, but I will when time allows.<br />For the time being, as long as I can get them on AMAZON for a decent $price$, I will continue to do so. It is nice to have several varieties, when available.<br />Though, I see some of the reviews do not rave about this item as much as I have here, personally, for what they are, I do not hesitate to recommend them and our family enjoys them in moderation."

This tastes great and have lost weight!,"I am surprised by how good this breakfast cookie's flavor is; it has depth of spices and textures and is truly delicious.<br /><br />300 calories seemed a bit high, but I ate one with a large glass of water and it has been 4 hours and my tummy is not growling yet, I even worked out too.<br /><br />I love that it doesn't have any freaky ingredients and it was very soft and moist.  I gave a little pinch of it to my toddler daughter and she enjoyed it too.  I prefer to have actual oatmeal in the morning with fruit and yogurt, but these breakfast cookies are great if the morning goes sideways and I don't have time or opportunity to fix something.<br /><br />The problem I found with other protein bars and such is that in about 2 hours I was feeling peckish and looking for snacks until lunch.  I did not have that problem with this breakfast cookie,  it may have more calories than I thought I wanted to ""spend,"" but it is very worth it since it keeps me out of the kitchen until lunchtime.<br /><br />Another nice thing: there are not any chips or icing on this cookie to melt in the mid-day heat, so you can keep one of these in the purse or diaper bag without creating a big mess for yourself later ;)<br /><br />I keep them in the freezer for freshness, they are really moist and chewy once you let them thaw or microwave.  I put one on a saucer and nuke for 20-30 seconds from frozen solid, it turns out like its warm from the oven.  I do not recommend keeping them in the fridge, baked goods and bread will get dried out if kept there.<br /><br />UPDATE:I have lost 35 pounds in the last year with very minimal changes and these cookies have helped me go from not eating breakfast and snacking all morning, to eating breakfast no matter how busy and not needing to snack or eat until lunchtime. They are very filling and are perfect for when you don't have time to make anything."

This flavor tastes a little bland compared to the other for some reason even though it has more ingredients. But it's not inedible or anything, just a little bland.<br /><br />As for whether it helps you feel full.... I'd say it doesn't for me cause it's just a 3oz size afterall and I'm used to eating a lot more. But I always skip breakfast so eating this is better than nothing considering studies show breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Eating breakfast also helps you lose weight and raise metabolism.<br /><br />I'd give the taste 3 stars but bought it for amazing $2 (17 cents each cookie) so price gets 5 stars which avg out to 4 stars."

I keep them in the freezer as they recommend (you must do this as they can get mold otherwise) and they always taste fresh and fine to me. (They are wrapped/packaged very nicely for the freezer.) Also good in the toaster (crispy crust).<br /><br />These are one of my favorite quick breakfasts on hurried mornings, and sometimes I even enjoy them on a relaxed Sunday morning.

If a product is claiming to be a healthy breakfast, it should really have 100% unadulterated ingredients. (I'll give the Erin Baker's brand its due for using aluminum-free baking powder.) All that having been said, if you regard this as a cookie rather than a meal replacement, you'll be happy with it. It's healthy for a cookie, tastes decent, and fantastically convenient (take it out of the freezer in the morning and it's good to go in 2 hours without heating). But despite what other reviewers have said, it's a high-calorie snack at best. I am a 115 lb female and this barely held me over for about 2 and a half hours before I was starving again. If you're someone with a small appetite, try packing it with a piece of fruit-- Bottom line, it's a healthy cookie, not breakfast, much less a healthy breakfast."

Store them in the freezer, pop them in the toaster and it's like eating a fresh baked cookie that is full of good things for you and keeps you from getting hungry till lunch.

While it was tasty and very fulfilling, I wasn't forsure if I was in love with them (and really, why waste your time eating something you don't love?) So, based on customer reviews I then tried the Morning Glory Breakfast cookie.. I loved the bits of nut and I have to say  it is tasty and fulfilling! It is my 2nd favorite cookie and I easily give them a 5 star rating!<br /><br />I again began browsing the cookie flavors and spent time reading customer reviews and decided to try the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk and all I can say is third times the charm. These breakfast cookies are knock your socks off delicious ! I plan on stocking up so that I don't have to order over the hot summer months (as I have read on some of the cookie reviews that because these cookies are so fresh and have no preservatives to prevent spoilage that they are prone to mold if left out to long), so I figure, why take the chance? I'm just going to make several purchases before summer gets here!!!<br /><br />I totally recommend these breakfast cookies! My only wish is that they came in a variety box so one isn't forced to purchase a whole pack to sample one flavor. Yes, they are a little high calorie, so you might not want to use them as a snack, but for a meal replacement they are fantastic ! I love the natural ingredients and I know these cookies are fresh (makes you wonder how ""fresh"" those meal replacement bars are that sit on the store shelf for months?)"

I ate one of these and a cup of Joe and I was full. Delicious!  Heated it 20 seconds. That of course is unfrozen.  I immediately froze the rest to keep them fresh as no preservatives in them. I think you have to heat it about 40 seconds when frozen.  My son had one (He is 21) and he had to have two to fill him.  He likes them a lot. My Mom had one and she was full.  She could not quit talking about how good they are. Another reason  I also wanted to try these is because my Mom has Alzheimers and cannot cook on stove safely anymore. She likes to snack and get things herself so these are perfect.  She can still use the microwave. I feel these are healthy eating and that makes me feel good. We all have medical disabilities so the easier the better. The really cool part is that they are just a little over a 1.00 each for breakfast! We love the Morning Glory and am fixing to order more with Amazon Prime. By the way for those of you who don't know about Prime, it is wonderful and we have saved so much on shipping this year. Also, it is quick 2 day free shipping and 3,95 for overnight.  I try to only buy products that have Prime on them. Our cookies came today (a Saturday) with Prime 2 day by Fed Ex. That is another thing I love is shipping is free with Prime on these. If you shop  a lot on Amazon (which I am doing more and more) the 70.00 is a great value for a years membership.

The nibs are crunchy, high in antioxidants, and a little bit bitter, but the dark chocolate balances the bitterness nicely.<br /><br /> The chocolate covered bananas were also delicious.

While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!!

I have been known to like things hot (although my tastes have mellowed with age) and I would rate this between mild and medium.  I have tasted commercially prepared breakfast sausage that tasted hotter.  It definitely makes this a great sausage for using in spaghetti and other italian dishes.  By itself, the sausage is very flavorable.  We plan to pack 1/2 into casings and bulk store the rest for cooking Italian dishes.<br /><br />I do agree with one reviewer, it is a bit salty tasting and could be toned down a bit.

The last one was in Maine and it closed down in 2010 - this was big news already. The reasons for this are multiple: California's Sardine processing crashed after overfishing of California Sardines ruined the industry in CA for a while. The cost of buying American processed Sardines was too high of a price for Americans, who simply opted to buy the stuff processed in Morocco and Portugal.<br /><br />Blaming this particular company for sending off the fish to Vietnam is misplaced criticism.

I especially like the one that seeks to educate. That is unfortunate there are no more canneries here in the States.<br /><br />Here's my reality:<br /><br />I believe this company is out to put out quality products. And if your really concerned about their business practice do some due diligence. They have a website.<br /><br />I stopped for years eating anything out of a can. And for a single person I can't afford buying wild fish in bulk. I love the fact that this company puts out this product. Being of a Pacific Island decent (born and raised in the U.S  and proud to buy american) the food my ethnic community eats is a horrible combination with all that msg and salt. Not all asians eat vegetables. Particularly Filipino's. They fry everything and eat too much bread. It's the spanish influence. I respect their dietary choices but it didn't work for me.<br /><br />About 10 years ago I gradually shifted my health. I believe in moderation. And I do research the companies I buy from. I've never considered sardines. Then I tried the Sardines in Olive Oil and I am hooked.<br /><br />I study the health benefits of all things. I've been doing it for 10 years now. I study psychology and do yoga.<br /><br />Health first comes from your mind. It comes down to testing and learning what your body likes. It doesn't help to scare people into health. It doesn't work in the long run. I've met health freaks that worry so much about the negatives that it physiologically affects their health. There is such thing as too much information. You have to enjoy what you eat. Simple.<br /><br />I eat this stuff out of the can. The flavor is fantastic. It's great with some brown rice and veggies. I haven't quite made the transition to totally raw and I don't think I ever will but this is the next best thing.<br /><br />Price is not comparable to the price of your health. Most don't know how to measure that. The way I watch people waste their money on things like eating out, booze and claim they save money to buy one dollar microwaveable meals doesn't compare. Those ""frugal"" individuals suffer long term when they get older. They are the same people that poke fun at folks like me who take supplements and do yoga. I see a long term investment that most people tend to neglect: YOUR BODY! Your health needs to balance on ALL levels: mind and body. That's when you reap the benefits.<br /><br />If you want great healthy food for an affordable price and still support the planet, then support this company.

12050,B003H7YHUW,A204G7E13UW2B0,Andrew Schonbek,3,5,3,1293408000,Deconstructing Environmental Cred,"There's nothing really wrong with these sardines, though as noted below I don't particularly care for their smoky taste. My problem is with the marketing, which attempts to justify an inflated price with a dissertation of a long list of purported benefits. Problem is, most if not all of these benefits apply to all brands of sardines, not just these.<br /><br />One thing I'll say at the outset: If BPA free packaging is your most important purchase criterion read no further and buy these now. The packaging is indeed BPA free.<br /><br />But what about the whole concept of ""wild"" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.<br /><br />On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that all sardines are wild, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.<br /><br />Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about.<br /><br />For instance there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're ""sustainably caught along the California coast"". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are ""processed in Viet Nam"". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, ""These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations"".<br /><br />There are other issues as well.<br /><br />The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, ""Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk..."". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.<br /><br />We also learn that these ""delicious meaty portions"" are ""cleaned and scaled"". Buyer beware: this is quite different from ""skinless and boneless"". ""Cleaned"" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.<br /><br />How do they taste?<br /><br />Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring. These babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky, salty taste.<br /><br />But don't worry. It's not just any smoke, but ""aqueous natural smoke"" that they're treated with..."
12051,B003H7YHUW,A2XJ04D0UPVGNP,Mizerello,13,21,3,1276041600,Great Tasting But Disappointed They're Packed in Vietnam,"I recently found Wild Planet and purchased both the Wild Sardines and their Tuna.  The taste is amazing in both the sardines and tuna.  It simply can't be beaten and, they use BPA free cans which is very rare in this country.  Thanks to another review on Amazon, I discovered that many of the canned goods I was buying for my family that were organic, were also packed in cans coated in a lining that includes BPA.  I did some research and discovered Wild Planet.  Their tuna and sardines are more expensive but it's worth it because all of their products are sustainably caught, and packaged responsibly.  They're good for our planet and great for my family.  The only reason I'm not rating them 5 stars is because the sardines are processed in Vietnam and not the US.  The tuna is processed here. The sardines are not, and while I'm sure the canneries used are monitored by Wild Planet, I would much rather serve my family something that was packaged in this country giving fellow Americans much needed jobs.  I also think that with the price of the sardines, they should be packaged here.<br /><br />Anyway, if taste is your only concern, buy these sardines.  They're the best I've tasted.  If you care where your food is processed, these might not be for you--altho, no sardines are processed in this country anymore so I guess we're just out of luck. For some reason, we Americans don't seem to care that we now make very little in our own country.  Go figure."

Great caffeinated beans (whatever ""great"" means to the drinker) are pretty easy to find. But when it comes to decaf, pickin's get VERY slim.<br /><br />Kicking Horse is the best decaf for me. It's an even, very dark (consider it a french) roast and it's oily! (The whole ""oily vs. not oily"" is a never-ending debate.) Suffice to say, I prefer dark, oily beans and it's impossible to find oily decaf from a mass-production roaster.<br /><br />Admittedly, I have not performed a side-by-side comparison with caffeinated, but straight shots are remarkable. Few people would recognize that they were drinking decaf if they were served this coffee. (espresso or press, i can't speak to the taste of this coffee after drip)<br /><br />To qualify any opinion, it's important to understand the perspective of the reviewer. I don't evaluate coffee for qualities like ""florals"" or ""dark chocolate"" or ""berries"". I like rich espresso flavor, but without so much caffeine. So I cut my coffee with a dark decaf in order to get the richness that I want, and then smooth it with a little milk/cream - no sweetener, no flavorings.<br /><br />As an added bonus, I really appreciate the 15% discount for the monthly automated Amazon subscription."

So, if you can trust a U.S. label--why not trust a Chinese label?  These treats are sure a hit with our dogs--all 7 of them love the chicken, lamb & rice, & the duck with glucosamine & chrondroitin.  We buy this type because of our older dogs with severe arthritis.

I made the mistake of giving one to him at night before bed, and now he flat out demands these before bed or he pouts all night. Why?  Well, it's basically a healthy chicken jerky.  The ingredients are good, and so is the quality!  I am very sensitive as to what is in pet foods I buy, and this is a great treat!<br /><br />And I do have a comment about the person who mentioned that they are made in China. My response is so what?  I actually think it is a good thing!  We treat chickens (as mean as they are) so poorly here, and their waste pollutes our rivers and streams.  Land is a whole lot cheaper and easier to come by in China, and they don't tend to pack them as densely as they do here.  So thanks to China we have a great product with a much cheaper price point then we would normally have to pay for.  We are one world people, and if another country can make a quality product with a lighter impact on the environment then we can, I am happy to share whatever the profits are with them.  Sure they made many mistakes industrializing, and I am sure they will make more... just as we will.  However, they are very sensitive to maintaining quality at a good price point, and I have more faith in chicken coming from China then I do from the US... sad to say but true.<br /><br />So back to the review.  While the quality and look of the product is great looking, the smell indicates that the flavors are probably stronger then just regular chicken (think of beef jerky).  If your dog has a very sensitive tummy I would buy a small pack first and make certain that it digests easily.  As for my dog, a Golden Retriever, he would likely gobble the whole bag if he could, and not think twice about doing it again the next day."

But cage free in the US and in China doesn't mean happy chickens either place - it just means they're in a barn (usually without light) - check out Food, Inc. and many other documentaries.  If it were natural for my dogs, I'd have them go vegan too, but right now I do what I can with the humans in our family and try to pick what seems to be the least harmful to all other sentient creatures sharing this planet.<br />So that being said, this product compares to other chicken jerky products for dogs out there just fine and to boot does not have hormones.  Also, the individual slices are thinner than many other brands which helps the dogs chew these properly (fewer larger chunks swallowed).  The price is great to boot - I highly recommend these and will be buying more (at least until there is some healthy vegan jerky for dogs that I can afford!)"

So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.<br />See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.

My dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken, they should be excellent treats. However, I do not trust pet foods sourced from China. Most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets. It remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured. The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you). Overall, I recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made 100% from US grown and processed ingredients."

I would wake up and find throw up and diarrhea in the house seemingly every time I gave him a duck treat the day before. I didn't want to believe it. I thought perhaps his water bowl was slimy and cleaned it. All was well. I gave him another duck treat a few days later and he got sick again several hours later. Well, I stopped giving him Dogswell Happy Hips Duck treats and he has been fine since then.<br /><br />So, I don't know if it's just a bad batch of treats or if he somehow became sensitive to these treats or if they are contaminated with something.

I almost forgot about it, but a few weeks later I found them in the back of the cabinet and tried them again. She got very ill again. Especially since she's rarely sick, it's difficult to ignore the link between these treats and her illness.  Unless and until there's some quality control on these, I highly recommend finding a different treat. As for the issue of 'made in china', I only looked at the packaging more carefully after reading some reviews, and in fact,the packaging clearly states that the product is made in china.

We bought a batch of the Beef Liver to add a little variety to the whole routine - and oh, my gosh!<br /><br />The dog LOVES these treats!  She's ready to put on a tu-tu and prance around the kitchen to beg for them.  Forget the dignity afforded to canine senior citizens - this pooch is acting like her old juvenile self!  I don't know if they are more potent than the duck or chicken treats, but they sure seem to pack some sort of punch!<br /><br />I made the mistake of giving the neighbor dog a taste.  Now she won't go away!  Every time I turn around she's at the back door looking for more - she certainly never acted this way with the duck or chicken!<br /><br />Did I mention that they were disgusting??  They ARE!  Unlike the other ""flavors"" of Happy Hips these things absolutely REEK!  And forget about them looking like ""beef jerky"" - nope!  They're real dried out liver - mostly little dried square bits that remind me of mica or shale (they're almost crystalline).  There's no pretending this is anything other than what it is - nasty gross protein of the variety that dogs LOVE!  At least it's sanitary and not the dead stuff they like to roll in out in the yard.<br /><br />Yes, I'll be forced to buy these again.  My 14 year old is rather irresistible with her old-lady gray hair, sassy grin, and wagging tail!  They are a healthy all natural treat with no added hormones, fillers or other nasty stuff.  I just wish they didn't smell so bad!<br /><br />December 2010 UPDATE:<br /><br />I'm happy to report that Ceilie is still making her way around the yard at nearly 16 years old thanks in large part to the Happy Hips brand of treats.  We were pulled out of town last winter for a family emergency and had to leave her with a relative for a week.  She didn't do well adjusting at all, so by the time I got back home I was really scared I was going to lose her.  I don't know if she had a stroke or just refused to eat, but she could barely walk and couldn't hold her head straight.  It took a week of encouraging her to eat senior dog food (a cut up hot dog plus chicken broth helps) and regular dosing of glucosamine and chondroitin via these treats to pull her out of it.  Now I have to be careful that I don't run out.  If she doesn't get her dose of these each day she goes down hill really fast.  The vitamin option doesn't sit well on her tummy so I persist in spoiling my grey haired old lady with these treats.  Amazon's prices and delivery can't be beat."

Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.<br /><br />Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?"

I am asking Amazon for a refund - otherwise, they are going in the trash unused.<br /><br />Copied from FDA web site.<br /><br />FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products<br />November 18, 2011<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.<br /><br />FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.<br /><br />Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.<br /><br />FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in the U.S., is working to determine why these products are associated with illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN) is now available to support these animal health diagnostic laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.<br /><br />The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin. Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to [...]"

The product has a sealed lid, not a ""pop-top lid"" and the amount of protein and sodium have changed.  See below for the correct information.  I have notified Amazon of this error.  Somehow 5 grams of protein have been ""lost"" from the can contents.<br /><br />I purchased the 4.5 ounce can of Swanson white premium chunk chicken breast on sale at CVS - buy one, get one free for $3.00 ($1.50 per can).  This large size can 12-pack works out to be a better deal even though it's not a sale price and subscribing to purchase this product on a schedule reduces the price per can even more.<br />I am wondering if the person who commented that the meat was a mixture of white and dark meat ordered or received the wrong product since there is a similar product available for a lower price that is a blend of white and dark meat.  This 9.75 ounce net weight can contains all white meat and just the right amount of broth that's easy to drain off or use.  The chicken looks appealing and it tastes mild and flavorful. It is great for making chicken salad sandwiches or for adding to soup or any other food item.  The meat flakes into small pieces easily, so you may not want to add it to your soup stock until just before you are ready to serve it.  It would also make a good filling for enchiladas, tortillas or quesadillas.  I have no problems at all with the taste or texture of this product.  It is appealing when you open the can and it would work well for many recipes or quick meals or snacks.  For those who don't like tuna, it's a great alternative.<br />Basically, it's chicken when you need it ready to go, and it is a good source of protein with very little fat.  One can contains 5 servings with each serving containing 50 calories, 9 grams of protein, 1 gram of fat, 25 mg of cholesterol (8% of DV), 1 gm of carbohydrate and 260 grams of sodium(does that include the broth?).  If sodium is a concern, consider adjusting the amount of salt that you add to your recipe or maybe you could even lightly rinse the drained chicken in a strainer.<br />It's certainly better than buying luncheon meat and keeping it for too long!  It's fresh when you need it.  I have a couple of cans stored in my refrigerator now. This chicken contains no MSG and no artificial flavor - just less than 2% food starch and sodium phosphates.(okay sodium phosphates may not appeal to some)<br />Update:<br />Just opened another can and added it to a healthy variation of macaroni and cheese.<br />I haven't tried the concoction yet, but the chicken looked wonderful when I opened the can - appealing light pink color and chunky bits of meat like baked chicken breast."
12305,B0009XQSAY,A3CON26JT9UT80,George Thomas,5,7,3,1218499200,Damaged goods,"At least half the cans in my last order arrived in a crushed condition; not just dented but caved in. The inner and outer cardboard cartons that they were packed in were not damaged, so the cans had to have been damaged at the time the cartons were packed by the manufacturer, and not damaged during shipping. The can condition was such as manufacturers commonly donate to food banks, knowing that retail supermarket shoppers would not touch them. Perhaps disposing of such product through Amazon.com rather than taking a charitable writeoff is a more cost effective strategy for a manufacturer. Buyer beware when buying products sight unseen. The chicken itself was OK."

For a quick, guilt-free snack, it's tasty just smashed up in its own broth.  Mixed with some relish & either mayo or ranch dressing, it makes a delicious salad to eat alone, in a sandwich, or on crackers.  My elderly/feeble parents loved it microwaved with various tuna helper flavors as an easy main dish.  This is great in all of my favorite cooked chicken recipes, & it's always in the pantry, ready to use on short notice, but keeping just fine (unlike refrigerated alternatives) until it's needed.

I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once."

Somehow almost every time I am ""making up"" some sort of savory recipe, this stuff makes it in there.  Just 2 weeks ago I had the idea to make dip with cream cheese, sour cream, the sauce and some seasoning.  It was a total hit at the play off party.  I just made it again today for our pre-superbowl potluck at work and got rave reviews again.

I use this type of bag for a few things in my life: camping gear (sleeping bag, hammock/tent) is able to breathe without being all over the place, storage of down comforter during summer, etc.  Then I got the great idea of using them for my recycling.  What a change in life this has been.  For three years, we've had to take moldy cans to the recycle center to redeem all our beer cans for the 5¢ apiece.  The little sips of beer in each can accumulate, and get trapped in a plastic bag, so I took my recycle cans and drilled holes in the bottom for drainage, then I line them with these bad boys.  The beer leaks right out, and when they're full, they're dry and while they smell slightly of stale beer, the change to that from stale wet beer and mold is incredible.<br /><br />Would I trust them for laundry?  Probably not if I had to carry it any distance.  They're mesh bags.  Going up or down stair or across the house is probably not a big deal.  Since I don't have machines, I wait until the last possible minute to do my laundry, so these bags would be totally and utterly full, stretching the mesh past its abilities, and would probably rip on the first or second go.  If you're smarter than me, though, and do your laundry in a reasonable amount of time, or don't have to leave your house/complex to do it, they'd probably be fine."

Apparently the 10 oz rating is including the weight of the ""cauldron"" because there's no way there was 10 oz of product inside. You might get three cups of ""hot chocolate"" per container if you like the ""flavor"" really mild.<br />It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price. Two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won't even be much use as decoration. Look for a better brand."

They had a clean, refreshing, decidedly strong rush of pure mint flavor. For years I enjoyed the intense, clean sweet flavor, as I bit into them. Unfortunately, Wrigleys (the new owners) have altered the flavor (more artificial ingredients?) and added blue artificial color to them. The mints now taste like cheap toothpaste, that leaves an unpleasant chemical aftertaste in your mouth. These once delightful mints are now ghastly! Let's hope the Wrigley's people with the uneducated palates don't mess with the Peppermint Altoids!  I will not buy these wintergreen mints again, unless they change back to the old style, which was full of natural mint flavor, and artifical color free.  If you are lucky enough to find a tin that does not list ""color (blue 1)"" in the ingredients list, you've found some of the old style wintergreen mints (the good ones).  The full ingredients list on the original good wintergreen altoids was (sugar, natural and artificial flavors, gum arabic, gelatin).  Since I wrote this review I've been fortunate to find about a dozen boxes of the good, old mints.  These were at small out of the way grocery/drug stores that tend to charge a little more for their products.<br /><br />July, 2012: Well, it's been a year since I've been able to find a box of the good, old mints.  I broke down and bought a box of the new version today.  Wrigley's has added some of the natural flavor back to these mints, and they do taste slightly better.  However, they have left in the artificial color ""blue 1"", which negatively affects the flavor, and leaves  a bit of bitter aftertaste.  I won't buy them again.  I did buy 6 boxes of the Peppermint Altoids.  Thankfully, they are still the original formula, and as good as ever!"

You get a short burst of minty flavor and then at least an hour's worth of a synthetic/chemical aftertaste which is quite unpleasant. I'll not buy them again unless Wrigley's returns to the original recipe. I guess they are saving a few cents by changing the recipe, but they are going to lose a whole lot of customers in my opinion.<br />  I would have rated the old Wintergreen Altoids with all the stars in the firmament, but the new ones rate none at all.

Just keep an eye on them if you have more than one dog because if they are not used to having treats like this, they can become territorial! They realaxed after a couple of days and now they take turns. They are smelly!!! First couple of days they ate them outside but once they started turning white I let my dogs bring them in the house and they chew on them all day and night (not continuously) till they go to bed.  Also a great treat if you have a nervous/neurotic dog because this helps them channel their nervous energy."

Something about that mix can bring you back to your childhood or make you think of comfort food.  Sadly, this bar isn't quite what I expected, but it still has it's good points.<br /><br />I like the Larabars, they can be quite delicious.  That being said, I think I've discovered that the ones not involving fruit (i.e. peanut butter, chocolate, etc.) are not as good tasting.  This one, I did like the taste of cherries that was in it, and the touch of salt.  But the peanut flavor just wasn't as good.  It wasn't very sweet, which is fine, but it didn't really taste peanutty either.  Just an average mix of flavors.<br /><br />The ingredients in this bar are very good though.  There's only four.  Dates, peanuts, cherries and sea salt.  That's it.  Which is incredible.  I like foods like that that only have a few ingredients and nothing overly processed.  The bar has 210 calories.  So it's not a light snack.  This is better for while you are exercising or as a meal replacement.  I had it as breakfast and it worked just fine at filling me up.  There is 10 grams of fat in the bar and 19 grams of sugar.  So like I said before, not a light snack by any means.  It does have 4 grams of fiber though, so that's healthy.  And there's a little bit of natural vitamins in there from the fruit.  Protein is 6 grams, which isn't huge, but isn't bad for after you've been running (or before!).<br /><br />I probably wouldn't get this flavor again.

My son has autism and according to his IgE and IgG panel test he has about 20 food sources that he has to avoid, such as: gluten (wheat, barley, rye), oats, milk, garlic, walnuts, sesame, grapefruit, coconut, and so on. I myself am sensitive to gluten and dairy and would get bloated and heartburn if I consume gluten or dairy. So this may not be the fault of this product because I found it to be a great product. I suggest if you have any GI issues you check with a good GI doctor, not just ANY GI doctor. The best GI doctor in the world is Dr. Arthur Krigsman. He practices either at Throughtful House in TX or in NYC. He has helped so many children with autism and addressed their GI issues that eventually the autistic behaviors improve. My son has been treated using simiar protocols by our DAN! doctor, Dr. Neubrander in NJ, and has recovered from autism just by cleaning his GI problems.<br /><br />I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it would not use sugar. It uses sugar cane, but natural sugar or not it's still sugar. Sugar feeds yeast, and yeast causes GI and neurological issues (definitely behavior issues with my son). Signs of yeast overgrowth: dark circles under the eyes, red cheeks/ears, rashes/ezcema, hyperactivity, fatigue, craving for carbs and sugar, and so on (check out SCD diet on the Internet). I would rather use Stevia or Xylitol, so I wish this product didn't come sweetened. Xylitol actually has an added benefit, to prevent and fight cavities, since we don't use fluoride at home (fluoride is toxic, and it binds to calcium but it can't tell the difference between calcium and lead, so it increases metal retention in your body).

I used to wear a lot of hemp (before doing so was part of the ""organic"" eating movement I guess?)... and I remember chewing on the necklace/bracelets.

Most shake mixes actually dissolve in liquid; this stuff just sorta clumped into the liquid.<br /><br />On the other hand, I ate (almost) all of it... and it was much more palatable once I mixed it in with the meijer shake mix (2 parts meijer mix, 1 part this stuff).

It is definitely different and could for many have to be an acquired taste. It is not as sweet as some would guess but is versatile so adding fruit, honey, or another sweetener to it may make it a little more palatable for those who can't tolerate it's straight out of the container flavor. It is not completely water soluble so it does have a slightly grainy texture but that is part of the appeal to me. It has 11 grams of protein, 9 grams of fiber, and having only 90 calories would not make it a good meal replacer but a good compliment to a healthy one or a nice mid meal snack. It is organic which in my opinion doesn't mean a whole lot but the fact that it is GMO free and contains a simple and natural ingredient list appeals to me. I am not a vegetarian and love me some animal flesh but this would be a great addition to any vegan or vegetarian diet as it is an easily digestible protein source. I purchased the chocolate which I had tried a couple years ago (before they switched to the new formula- not sure of the exact changes that were made) it is great and I also purchased the vanilla that I have yet to try. I would definitely say to the newcomers go out and find the single serving packets before you commit to entire container- I love it but it just may not be to your liking."

12736,B001ELLB4S,A2U1S8Q26R0TMF,Mia,0,0,3,1349049600,The taste is alright,"I hate chocolate. I used to have this on subscribe and save because the two pack was cheaper than buying the other flavors individually. Unfortunately, the only two pack on subscribe and save was chocolate flavor. I was able to get past the taste despite really wanting to try the other flavors, but there were a few side effects to this particular brand of hemp mix.<br /><br />I would get really irritating tooth aches -- in my gums or teeth -- after I made a shake with this. I've narrowed it down to the inulin or the guar gum. I tried the Manitoba (vanilla) and never experienced an ache. I then tried the super berry version of Nutiva Hemp Shake and my tooth/gum pain returned. Also, I would never ever recommend the super berry flavor; it tastes like flintstones children's vitamins.<br /><br />Three stars go to a not-so-bad flavor. I think someone who actually likes chocolate will enjoy this flavor. However, some of the ingredients clearly gave me a reaction, so I couldn't give this product a full five stars. I think the inulin and guar gum are unnecessary ingredients, but I believe it's what they use to make this mix more 'mixable,' as compared to Manitoba's (which has only three ingredients total) 'sandier' texture. I don't mind the texture of Manitoba's. I don't need a smooth hemp shake, but the texture seems to really bother some other reviewers. If you prefer smoother over grittier, then try this one (but I hope you try them both to make your own comparison.)<br /><br />**Update 25/10/12<br /><br />I wanted to say that it would have to be the inulin. I was looking at the ingredients in a raw meal powder that I used to take and it has guar gum, and I never experienced gum or tooth pain with it.<br /><br />ALSO, in regards to how horrible the super berry flavor tastes: I tried it with apple juice today and it redeemed itself. I was trying to finish off the container that I still have and normally I mix my Manitoba hemp with water or apple juice and tried it with the super berry Nutiva. It actually tastes very good with apple juice -- they compliment eachother perfectly. I used soy and 7 grain milks before, so I would just recommend trying super berry with juice if you also think it tastes bad."

I mix it up in a Blender Bottle (also sold on Amazon) with a little water and some type of milk. I really like mixing it with vanilla hemp milk or whole grain rice milk but regular milk works fine, too!<br /><br />Nutiva is the LEAST grainy hemp shake I have come across yet.

It's hard to describe - it actually is very hempy, if you are familiar with the taste. That's fine if you like it, but I didn't think it went well with chocolate. It's also very strong and sweet.<br /><br />There is also very little texture added by the powder, so smoothies made with this are thinner than those made with other protein powders."

It also irritates my throat for some reason, in fact at first I thought I was having some kind of reaction, but it has subsided since I've started writing this review.<br /><br />Like everyone else is saying, this 'protein' shake doesn't have much protein.

If you're used to traditional whey-based protein powders and want something similar, you may not like this.  It's a bit of an acquired taste and has a different mouth feel.  I don't like whey or soy powders, and wanted something with a lot of fiber that wouldn't aggravate my acid reflux.  The hempshakes fit the bill for me.  I can drink them mixed in soy or rice milk, but usually I make a quick smoothie in the morning to drink in the car while I'm taking my son to school.  This fills up for a few hours but doesn't make me feel stuffed.  I blend together 1/2 cup juice (usually Odwalla Blueberry B Monster), 1 cup soy or rice milk, a banana, and 4 tablespoons of hempshake powder.  If I need it to last me until lunchtime I'll add in a cup of frozen berries.  It's a healthy way for me to start the day, and I don't end up skipping breakfast anymore.<br /><br />I haven't noticed a big difference between the old formulation and the new, except that the new seems a little smoother so I'd guess it's probably not as gritty if you're drinking it straight rather than in a smoothie.<br /><br />Long story short:  good product, but if the word ""hemp"" makes you cringe or laugh, this probably isn't something you're going to like."

Each packet contains both the Kool-Aid mix and the amount of sugar that's needed for a single drink. Perfect size for a typical water bottle. We use reusable watter bottles with them, so we can fill them up with water when ever we need something to drink and then add the Kool-Aid.<br /><br />They taste just like when you mix a regular full sized pitcher of Kool-Aid, just in a single serving size.

12780,B0030MNHEG,AKBGBE9H1C0L6,Tanooki-san,0,0,4,1344211200,Good Stuff,"I saw this at my local Food 4 Less for less than $3 (5 oz.) and had to give it a try. I've seen this hot sauce online before but could never justify paying the high cost plus shipping so I thought $3 was actually pretty cheap. I was a little wary at first because when I looked at the ingredients to see what kind of peppers were used the first one listed was habanero. I'm not a fan of straight up habanero sauce. I've tried popular habanero hot sauces like El Yucateco and didn't like it. El Yucateco has a weird pungent smell to it that I can't get over and I find the taste somewhat off-putting. It's also too hot for me. But I saw on the label of Gringo Bandito that it uses a mix of various peppers so I figured it might be different.<br /><br />After tasting Gringo Bandito I was pleasantly surprised to find it doesn't taste the same as a regular habanero sauce. The smell is not sour or overpowering but rather has a nice spicy aroma. The combination of different peppers (habanero, jalapeno, red japanese chili, and more) seems to work well. It tastes good. It's got much more complexity than something like Tapatio. Tapatio's decent but has more of a vinegary taste to it. This is more balanced. It also has the perfect amount of medium heat to it; not weak and not too hot but still enough to give it a nice kick.<br /><br />So I like this stuff and recommend it wholeheartedly . I don't give it 5 stars because I don't love it like I do another hot sauce. My favorite hot sauce is the chile de arbol variety. The kind they give you at the taco shops that's orangish in color and comes in those round plastic containers. That's my absolute favorite but I haven't been able to find a good bottled version of it at the store. I would certainly keep buying this stuff though. Kudos to Dexter for creating a good hot sauce!"

12783,B0030MNHEG,A2F7UKPDCT1VPX,AlienLion,0,0,5,1341273600,Hooked. Take this seriously.,"I don't usually like hot sauce because all they do is burn my mouth but I am now literally hooked on GB. I don't know what they put in it but there is so much flavor and it's so perfectly balanced that it makes pretty much everything taste better, from eggs to steak to pizza. I can't eat anything without it. The smell alone will get your juices going and you can actually taste it before it kicks, and when it does, it's pleasant and just hard enough.<br /><br />Another thing I love is that it isn't just a spicy red watery liquid as most other sauces. You can see the peppers and the spices there, all ground into a paste and it looks, feels and tastes natural and fresh.<br /><br />I urge everyone to try it. I almost wish that it was not associated with Dexter Holland so that people wouldn't think of it as some famous musician's side project (although, then it wouldn't have the most awesome packaging of any hot sauce). He quite obviously takes this seriously though and so should you. Don't dismiss it, get it and you won't regret it."

This stuff is absolutely delicious, I seriously put it on everything. I keep a bottle in my office with me for my lunch everyday. I seriously can't get over how good this stuff is. It reminds me of a more tasty taco bell hot sauce initially, then the tangyness kicks in, next thing you know the burn of the spicy habanero is there.

I am not a big fan of the smell of cranberry so that may be why the score is low, if you enjoy that smell you may be surprised.<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened:<br />++Hot (1) - Flavor is very bland, if not for the smell I would think I was drinking hot water with the tiniest bit of flavoring.<br />++Iced (1.5) - Tastes a bit better over ice. but a bit thinned down<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (2.5)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) bring out the flavors a bit more, again I'm not a fan of the flavors so that is apparent in this review but the sweetener definitely improves the flavor.<br />++Iced (3.5) -  Better over ice! The flavor is definitely brought out more by the sweetener, would certainly take this over a sugar laden ocean spray cranberry cocktail or something of that nature. I could even see using this as a mixer in some adult beverages the taste is there for it.<br /><br />-2nd Steep (2.5) - When the tea was steeping the second time I was concerned I was in for further disappointment, the color is certainly lighter but the flavor is about the same level.  I always rate this to see how economical a tea is.<br /><br />Summary - My typical everyday go-to iced tea is a blend of hibiscus (for the BP lowering qualities and taste), and other flavors, and I am on a rooibos kick as of late. However as previously stated, I do not typically like the flavors of cranberry and/or pomegranate therefore I would not ordinarily be attracted to this flavor to begin with and am only drinking it because it was included with my order. I will certainly finish the box, but I would not buy it again. If you enjoy the flavor of pomegranate and or cranberry you will most likely enjoy it, and I would certainly not discourage you from it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back.

I associate that name with safe for people trying to avoid sugar, even though I have been challenged several times, perhaps by people that are trouble makers at best but obviously more informed on the subject than I will ever be.  Yes, they have their little taste for they are very tiny for all the unwrapping it requires to consume them and who knows which fruit is which, in the end they all seem to taste the same. Not like eating a mint mentos where the moment it goes in your mouth you know exactly what you are getting. Still, they serves its purpose, for the person that I bought these morsels consumes them without truce, and that makes me content, for I am trying in my limited ways to keep this person from consuming large quantities of sugar, if I can help it, which is not all the time.

I bought it at my local warehouse store in a three-pound bag.<br /><br />The Aroma is the first thing you'll notice. Boy, does this stuff smell good! The aroma is wonderful, perhaps even better than the coffee itself. Please don't take that as a negative statement. I'm just saying that if you want to impress guests, just open up a bag of this stuff and the comments will roll in. The coffee itself is quite excellent, as you would expect. It has a nice aroma and a rich dark taste. My own tastes might prefer a slightly lighter roast, but that's only my own tastes and not the fault of the coffee. If you prefer the rich, deep, strongly-coffee-flavored brew, give this stuff a try. Wonderful! And it's at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />Gary Peterson."

The mango matcha has a grassy sweetness that definitely keeps the mango taste. The actual flavour isn't as strong as the smell, but I think that it would be overpowering if it was. I love this both hot and iced, which a slight edge going to the iced version. I haven't tried it yet in a smoothie, but I am thinking it would be fantastic.

There are few things better than slicing into a perfectly ripe mango. Makes a royal mess to eat it (at least, the way I did it), but it was so, so worth it. Still, I hate messy food, so if I can find that mango flavor without the mess, I am all for it! It was a bit worried about this tea after the strange bitterness of the Peach and Lemon flavors, but what's life without a few risks? Mango makes me think of summer and tropical smoothies and everything delicious in life.<br /><br />So when I opened it, it had that same smell the Peach and Lemon flavors had, a faint hint of bitterness, and I got worried. Still, never let it be said that I'm afraid to try new things. I made a cup of this to take to work with me, and thank goodness I did, it was a hellish day and I desperately needed the energy from it. But...it wasn't that great. It tasted like decent mango flavor with a back hint of chemicals. I don't know what it is, but I think I just need to stay away from the citrus group of flavored matchas. The Peach redeemed itself when iced, so maybe the mango will do the same. I'm hoping it does. My feelings may also be skewed a bit, I've been spoiled by the delicious goodness of the Mango Diablo from Davids, so my opinions on the mango flavor might have been different if I hadn't been drinking tons of the Mango Diablo lately. That's my new standard for mango flavor and this just doesn't match up to it.<br /><br />Still, it will be no great hardship to finish this off, especially in smoothies over the coming summer months. It's not horrible, it's just not for me. But maybe a lower temperature will help or finding another way to drink it. Or maybe one of my friends will try it and like it and then it will have a good home!"

I ordered this tea because I have some mastopathy and my breasts hurt much during my cycle. Things seemed to get a bit worse a couple months ago so I decided to give this tea a try. I come from a country where there is a lot of trust in herbal medicine, I personally was exposed to Chinese herbal medicine as well so I thought I should try. I drank it for about a month once per day and I already see results! During this cycle my breasts got much better, almost not sensitive at all, just a bit by the very end of it. I will continue drinking it and will recommend it to all my girlfriends with the same problems. It is natural, it doesn't contain any hormones and it DOES work. It tastes very much like regular green tea with jasmine(because it has a small portion of both of them) and that's why I don't recommend to drink it before going to bed because it can keep you up( green tea has a bit of caffeine, a tiny portion). I drink it either in the morning or at  lunch time, it tastes good and helps you to wake up( and unlike coffee, green tea doesn't damage your kidneys)."

The full flavor and balance of spices in this stuff is fabulous enough to literally 'eat if from the can'.  Seriously.  What amazed me is that I have asked dozens of pizza shop owners, and new restaurant 'attempts' at pizza recipes, what sauce they use....many going with food service items from wholesalers (Pastorelli DOES sell food service quantities).  Bland is the word with many sauces, and some too strong in their spices.  This family owned business has this science and art nailed down, and the quality of all of Pastorelli products is premium, without a high price tag.  If you want to really enjoy the best home made pizza, then Pastorelli's pizza sauces are the ONLY way to go.  Buy a can, jar (squeeze), and grab some of their new crusts, and then make up your own recipes and see for yourself.  The sauce 'carries' the pizza.  Their pasta sauces are amazing, yet not easy to find....hopefully their distribution will expand.  Personally, I love Amazon....so I'm set.

Pastorelli and Don Pepino. They both sell for roughly the same price, both are natural with no preservatives, so the only factor being judged here is taste. The Don Pepino won favoritism amongst my large family by 100%. The issue with the Pastorelli sauce is that it is overpowering to the point that when you bite into a slice all you taste is the Pastorelli. I'm not sure about everyone else, but my ideal pizza is one where the three parts (crust, sauce, & cheese) compliment each other and create a blended taste of all three. The Don Pepino did just that. At the end of the night all of the Don Pepino slices were gone but there were plenty of Pastorelli slices left."

One of the things that I just couldn't keep plated was when I put a little garlic/onion cream cheese on one of these crackers and topped it with a tidbit of smoked salmon. ;-) The only bad thing (and the first reason I won't give it 5 stars) is that the cracker gets soggy if you plate the stuff even just 30 minutes before serving, so you really have to make it as needed, or let it be self-serve/assemble.

I may be biased because I've loved gummi candies (ESPECIALLY those from Haribo) for pretty much my entire life. There's just something about the perfect combination of texture and bite that make chowing down on chewy fruit-flavored candy a happy activity.<br /><br />Strawberries are one of my favorite fruits so naturally I was overjoyed when I found out many years ago that Haribo made a gummi strawberry candy that, as a bonus, even looked like the fruit it was trying to imitate! They obviously don't taste like actual strawberries which have a sort of tartiness to them, but they do taste as good as if not better than any other imitation strawberry flavor out there.<br /><br />These candies are so good I can just munch on them - two or three at a time - for hours (which I guiltily admit I have done in the past at work). The price can't be beaten, either - believe me, I've looked high and low for a candy specialist that can sell this much sweet goodness at this low a price!<br /><br />And my family loves them as well. My two young boys can't get enough of them, and even my wife who doesn't really like gummi candy all that much can put down a dozen or so pieces.<br /><br />If you like strawberry flavored candy and love gummis, I highly recommend you try this (or even a smaller package if 5 lbs. scares you) - you won't be disappointed!"

I initially panicked when I saw them - both were packaged in ""Astronaut Mission Pack"" boxes that said they contained ""3 Assorted Freeze-Dried Space Foods."" This is not the packaging shown in the picture, and there is nothing on the box about Space Food Sticks (I wasn't too concerned about the magnet). The Space Food Sticks were the whole reason I ordered these samplers, as a surprise gift of nostalgia for a friend. When I finally opened the boxes, I saw that 2 Space Food Sticks and a magnet had been added each, so I DID receive the product that was promised. However, I still feel a bit cheated and deceived - I was expecting a fun gift box to present to my friend, as shown in the picture, and the boxes had some tears on them, perhaps from being opened to add the additional Space Food Sticks and magnet.<br /><br />In terms of the food items themselves - pretty much what I expected and I'm happy with them(and definitely what I was prepared for based on what other reviewers said).<br /><br />On a side note - because many of the older reviews for this product refer to additional items that are no longer included, it would be nice if they were updated or removed. I was sort of bummed to learn that this product used to come with freeze-dried food (that many reviewers seemed to love!) that are no longer included.<br /><br />Overall, I'm OK with the product - I got the food items I was expecting and most wanted - but the product picture needs to be updated, and the reviews should match the product currently available."

I picked this up for $13, and considering these things normally retail individually in gift shops for $4-$5 each. So just that alone was pretty nice. The other cool thing was just the fact that it contained more than the Neapolitan ice cream. I've never actually seen the chocolate chip, or the ice cream sandwich for sale anywhere else.<br /><br />Neapolitan: If you've ever had astronaut icecream before I'm sure this is the one you've had. It's a bar segmented into chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. It has a texture comparable to a lucky charms marshmallow. It's very light, and almost chalk-like in texture. Hold it in your mouth for a moment and it will start to melt. This is where you'll really get the true flavor of the product. Once it starts melting it tastes exactly like the flavor of icecream you're eating.<br />I give it a 4/5 stars. It's pretty good, and a great treat for anyone who has never had it before.<br /><br />Chocolate with Chocolate chips: This is just one big block of the chocolate ice cream from the Neapolitan bar. The main difference being that is it filled with chocolate chips. There's not much to say about this one that would differ from the Neapolitan. The texture, and flavor is all the same, and the chocolate chips don't taste any different than normal chocolate chips do.<br />I give it a 5/5 stars. This one is my favorite mainly because I just happen to love chocolate.<br /><br />Ice cream sandwich: This one was my least favorite of the bunch. I just am not too fond of ice cream sandwiches in the first place, and this really does taste like an ice cream sandwich. The chocolate sandwich part takes a big longer to get soft than the ice cream itself does, so you're likely to end up with a piece of the chocolate breading in your mouth with no ice cream.<br />3/5 stars. I just don't like the chocolate breading that much, and I felt like that was mainly what I was eating with this one.<br /><br />Chocolate space stick: If you've ever had a slim-fast bar, or most any other chocolate protein bar you'll already know what this is like. It's pretty much identical to a slim fast bar. It's very chewy, chocolaty, and it'll stick to your teeth. It's pretty good, but it's not something I'd want to eat all the time.<br />4/5 stars. If you're the kind of person that hates eating things that get stuck to your gums, and between your teeth I'd stay away from this.<br /><br />Peanut butter space stick: This one is the sister bar to the chocolate space stick. I'm not sure if I like it quiet as much. It seems to mostly be a slab of peanut butter coated in chocolate. The closest thing I can think of to describe it would be if you've ever had those reese's peanut butter cups that come out around easter, the ones shaped like eggs. That's pretty close to what this is like. Very dense low quality candy bar peanut butter. It was easily my least favorite of the box. I wouldn't say I hated it, but I certainly didn't like it, and if I were given the choice I would never purchase it on it's own.<br />2/5 stars. It just tasted like it was of a lower quality than the rest of the snacks. I'm sure it was packed with protein, but I bought these for novelty snacking reasons, not a long space voyage."

First of all this is NOT what NASA eats as their regular food supply. They do in fact have real fruits and other things like meat products and they do have freeze-dried snacks to reduce the weight on the space shuttle. this food is extremely light weight as compared to traditional foods. On a space shuttle launch every pound costs thousands of dollars so literately every pound counts. I would see this being a good snack pack for the crew of a space shuttle on the bridge or other space craft crew or the I.S.S(International Space Station)teams. But let me explain what exactly you are supposed to get in this sampler. Two 4inchesx4inches freeze dried astronaut ice cream squares one green mint chocolate chip and the other strawberry/vanilla/chocolate combo flavor, and one freeze dried ice cream sandwich. You also should get two astronaut space food energy bars with a refrigerator magnet. One chocolate and the other peanut butter. So basically what they show in the picture is what you get in this food sampler. But if you ask me it did make me thirsty. So I would drink a good amount of water after eating this stuff. Oh and FYI the ice cream is broken up into peaces so you can eat smaller peaces of of it. So my opinion is great sampler for the money. Just have water with yours."

There is more info in the description now about what you get but I was surprised to get so little.  Simply you get 3 of the astro ice cream packs that you would buy in the museum gift shops plus a few small items that were not of much interest to my son.  It would be less than half the cost to buy him 3 packs of the astro food at retail (museum shops).<br /><br />Check the bulk packs of 10 of the astro ice cream from the same supplier/seller.  These are about a 1/3 more expensive right now compared to the sampler but you get more than 3 times the quantity of astro ice cream.  I gave 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because it is a unique and sort of cool gift for someone who likes this astro ice cream.

I wanted to give it a fair try, and after about a dozen cups I can say, I am disappointed enough to not reorder it.  If Coffee Bean Direct coffee's are all like this, I won't be a return customer at all.  I have a one cup coffee maker, grind the beans fresh for each cup, so it's not a case of making a pot and letting it sit.  I really wanted to LOVE it after reading other reviews, but I just don't, and I doubt I will even after five pounds.

Next time I'll buy two bags and freeze one - the last bag we got was fresh enough to make that an option. I'd like to try some of the other blends from Coffee Bean Direct, too.<br /><br />The bag is laughably large, by the way. You'll open the box and say ""Whoa - now that's A LOT of coffee!"""

The prices really are great, and with the Amazon Prime shipping- the overall price truly can't be beaten. I love french roasted coffee- and this does not disappoint. If you do not like the smokey taste, then simply, do not buy any coffee that has the term ""french roast"" on the package!<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect from a Papua New Guinean coffee, and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a smokey, chocolate-cream taste. If it were a wine, it would be a Pinotage!<br /><br />Coffee Bean Direct roasts their beans fresh to order. When I purchased the first 5-pounder in February ('11) of the Brazilian French Roast, it had a roasting date of a few weeks earlier in January. On this package that I ordered in June, it also had the roasting date of January. So, it appears that Amazon is selling a large shipment they acquired from them months ago- be informed of that possibility.<br /><br />I have seen many people concerned about the five pounds not staying fresh once opened. Whatever you do- DO NOT REFRIGERATE OR FREEZE- that is some sort of urban legend/myth (lol) and actually speeds up the stale taste!  This is an easy fix!- Do what all coffee distributors do: store in a vacuum-sealed foil package. How? For the five pound bag, you will need about 10 gallon-sized VACUUM food storage bags (found in supermarket) and basic aluminum foil (also in supermarket.)<br /><br />1)Rip off one sheet of aluminum foil about 12-16 inches long<br />2)Lay foil flat on counter<br />3)Gently pour, roughly, 1/2 pound of coffee beans into the center of the foil sheet<br />4)Fold both of the width-side edges neatly over the center of the beans<br />5)Fold the length-side edges neatly over the top and towards the center (much like sloppily wrapping a rectangular present)<br />6)Place this foil package in the vacuum food storage bag- making sure that longer portion of the foil package is put in the bag parallel to the seal of the bag, which would leave much empty space between the foil package and the top of the bag.<br />7)Seal the bag, then vacuum-seal the bag by using the hand pump (can be purchased with the vacuum bags)<br />8)Do this with the remaining coffee beans (leave the amount of beans in the bottom of the coffee bag that you will be using within the next few days)<br />9)Check each plastic bag, by using the pump again to make sure they are vacuum packed.<br />10) Place each bag neatly and carefully either in a box, or a canvas bag (or some sort of storage to keep light out)<br />11) Store in a room temperature closet (about 60-75 degrees F)- making sure the bags will not be moved around too much or dropped as the vacuum seal could break.<br />12) Check the vacuum seal periodically and re-pump if necessary<br />13) This coffee will stay fresh for months this way!<br /><br />May seem like a bit of work, and adds to the cost with the price of the vacuum food storage bags- but, it's worth it!"

Although there is ample advertising and promotional information printed on the bag, I was left clueless as to where the arabica beans were grown.  That's why I called this ""mystery coffee.""  My usual brew is made from freshly-ground, all Colombian grown 100% arabica beans from a top-rated coffee supplier.<br /><br />Since I'm a serious coffee drinker, I would not usually buy such small bags of it.  An 11-ounce bag will make about three full 10-cup pots of coffee for me at the strength that I usually brew (1 level tablespoon full of ground coffee per cup brewed which is half-again more than Melitta recommends).  Melitta used such a strong adhesive to seal the bag, I had to nearly destroy the top of the bag to get into it.  Once opened, the bag yielded a hearty, pleasant fragrance of freshly-ground coffee.  I expected that it would brew good-tasting coffee with a bold taste and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Melitta recommends using their brand of filters because they've ground the coffee finely to extract the maximum flavor, but my usual store-brand filters worked just fine.  If your coffee preference is for bold but not bitter over mild you'll probably find this coffee to be satisfying; more like Starbucks than Dunkin' Donuts coffee.<br /><br />Ultimately choosing a favorite brand of coffee, for most people, is a matter of taste and cost.  This collection is certainly worth considering if you like your brew to be potent and to actually taste like coffee instead of like something else or wish to share this tasty coffee experience by giving one of these small bags as a gift.  I enjoyed this coffee but wouldn't buy such small bags of it regularly for my own consumption.  My top-rated bean coffee comes in more convenient packaging and costs me less."

I got brown colored water.<br /><br />Then I doubled it. Tasted kind of like a cheap grocery store canned brand.<br /><br />Finally I filled a #4 filter about 1/3 full to about 9 oz of water. That produced the best results, but I still just wasn't thrilled with the flavor.<br /><br />So you know where my taste in coffee is coming from, I normally drink medium roast (which this is), so that isn't the issue. I do normally grind my own, but again pre-ground won't cause that big of a difference. My preferred daily coffee is Safeway house brand medium roast Colombian, but lately due to finances I've been drinking a dollar store brand called ""Eight O'Clock"" that's of similar (though different) quality to the Melitta.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you'd like a quality coffee in this price range look at Seattle's Best (Starbucks milder step child) or if you have a Safeway their house brand beans are quite good.<br /><br />Edit: I compared the Melitta today with a similar Millstone (Medium Roast Colombian Supremo).

For one or two persons, it's a great way to make coffee. I have always used regular<br />grind coffee with a Melitta basket, but the Classique Supreme has changed my mind. Melitta's<br />coffee is ground very finely, almost to a powder consistency, which works better with their<br />drip basket system. I often ran the water through twice with regular grind, but don't need to<br />do so with the Melitta coffee. Whenever I can eliminate a step, I'm happy.<br /><br />This particular Melitta coffee, the Classique Supreme, has a rich flavor compared to the<br />rather ordinary coffees that I've gotten used to.

I was expecting a grocery-store quality coffee, but it far surpasses anything I've purchased at my local supermarket and, interestingly enough, I like it better than most beans I've purchased at specialty coffee shops.  Here's why:<br /><br />It's got a bold flavor akin to Kenyan beans but has a rich, full, smooth (almost chocolatey) texture like Sumatra.  As if combining the best bits of my favorite coffee regions wasn't enough, it's a very low acidity coffee, almost completely lacking that bitter / burnt aftertaste that plagues so many dark blends.  It's not a ""bright"" coffee like those grown in Latin America.  I believe this blend of coffee would be absolutely PERFECT FOR DESSERT SERVICE, but shouldn't necessarily be limited there.<br /><br />I've brewed a few pots at work to rave reviews.  Even the barely-colored-water-that-she-calls-coffee gal shrugged and said it was good.  I'm not inclined to drink my coffee black, but this blend is smooth enough to be palatable, even for me.  In fact, I surprised myself by enjoying my first 10oz cup with no creams or sweetener.

I'm not sure it is any better than some of the specialties you can purchase in your local grocery (I'm not talking Folgers and Maxwell House here, but the other shade-grown coffees).<br /><br />If this product comes up in a good sale, I might be tempted to purchase it for a special occasion but otherwise, I probably won't be buying again."

I drink my coffee black, and I love the varieties from Starbucks, Seattle's Best, Gevalia, Arriba!.  So when I had the opportunity to try this new coffee from Melitta, I was eager to see what they had to offer.<br /><br />My setup is a Gevalia 12 cup coffee maker using Melitta No. 4 unbleached cone filters.  For the trial, I brewed 6 cups of the Melitta the same way that I do my Starbucks - two rounded scoops using the Gevalia coffee scoop.  I was a little surprised at how light it came out, and it did not have a lot of flavor.  It definitely came out lighter than the other coffees that I have used - I have been getting satisfying results from my coffee maker and brands listed above using this method for 5 years.  For the next few pots that I made I used ""heaping"" scoops to try to get it stronger.  While it came out darker, I was disappointed in the overall flavor.  Since this is listed as a ""medium"" roast, I was looking for something on par with either either the Starbucks House or Peru Chanchamayo roasts.  This may be unfair since these are both Latin American beans, and I could not find anything about the origins of the Melitta Classique Supreme.  I found the flavor slightly earthy, but there just wasn't a lot that stood out.  I like coffees that are have citrus flavors or rich and nuttier.  Ultimately it is more of a lack of flavor that stuck with me.  It is unoffensive but underwhelming.<br /><br />If you are a current Starbucks or other coffeehouse drinker, you will likely find this somewhat disappointing.  If you are looking for a step up from Folgers you might like what you find.  As I think about a little harder, I would say that this compares favorably with Millstone coffee.  You'll probably like this coffee from Melitta if Millstone is right up your alley."

If you need coffee for the office where you can't grind fresh, this is better than supermarket coffee (that often includes cheaper Robusta beans) by a long shot  Brew it a bit stronger than recommended to get a full taste.  You can't get it to taste like dark roast by making it stronger - that just makes coffee bitter.  If you want dark roast, buy dark roast.  Medium roast offers pleasures of its own, and can let the individual qualities of coffee come through nicely.<br /><br />Fine grind coffee is meant to made in a filter cone, and this stuff is pleasant and smooth with some personality when done that way.  So if you're looking for a  convenient ground medium-roast blend for weekday mornings and don't want to go through the hassle of picking out some fancy coffee and grinding it at the store, this is a good reliable solution.  Melitta has a good reputation for a reason.<br /><br />Oh, and it is Kosher, too."

Melitta has a good name and maybe if this coffee were brewed in a Melitta Coffee maker and filter; it might have a different flavor.  It was okay.

Reviewing coffee is a matter of taste, literally as well as figuratively, and I found this to be a fairly standard, but not at all bad, mid-range roast. On some tastings, it reminded me quite a bit of McDonalds coffee, which isn't necessarily a bad thing though it probably isn't either as ""classique"" or as ""supreme"" as the folks at Melitta would like. It was very drinkable across the course of a morning, neither aggressively dark and bitter nor bland and tasteless. Though I might venture out from time to time into other roasts and blends, this would be a perfectly serviceable day-to-day option for coffee fans."

I am an avid coffee drinker and have at leat 6 cups every morning.  It is just part of my regular routine.  I crave the cafeine and the taste just wakes me up and starts any day perfectly.  I always get a medium blend and find that with generic coffee be it Folgers, Maxwell House or any store brand I don't really notice a taste difference.<br /><br />So it was a treat to try a coffee that is considered  a delicacy and not just a power boost.  This coffee is a pleasure from just opening the bag.  The aroma of just the beans is beautiful.  And when you go to make the coffee you will probably do the same as me and go to measure the amount equal to the water amount the same as when you make your standard coffee.  But you may have to toy with the measurement of coffee per ounces of water to be able to fully appreciate this coffee.  It was nice to have this coffee that is part of a specialty collection meet up to my expectations.  The beans are ground extra fine and though still providing a medium blend quality it far surpasses my regular coffee.  It definitely is smoother and the taste is rich and full providing a very satisfying coffee experience.  I found myself slowing down and enjoying each sip with absolute pleasure.<br /><br />As I said I am not one to explore all the supposedly specialty roasts or flavored coffees but am very glad I came across this Melitta blend.  Very satisfying and will definitely become part of my coffee regime when a definite treat is needed."

The coffee was good, certainly better than what I've had at a lot of restaurants, but it wasn't great.

It's for you if you like mainstream flavor blends and a medium roast but want to step up in quality. $6 for 11 ounces (one bag) is a fair price and it gets more affordable if you do the subscribe-and-save deal which comes with free shipping. The vacuum bag makes for a compact package when you're storing it before use and seals tight after you open it; the quality is a cut above from some other vacuum bags I've tried that leak coffee grounds, making a mess in the pantry.<br /><br />One odd thing, my three-pack came with just one bag coffee in a wasteful big cardboard shipper. I was getting it for review so can't complain, but this is not typical of Amazon."

Secondly, it smells great brewing.  I know I am having a good coffee day when I can smell it.  The taste is delicate but flavorful.  I tried it black, black with equal, and then black with equal and powdered creamer (my favorite flavoring) and each time, the coffee was enjoyable.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this coffee again.

So when I got the chance to try out the Melitta brand of coffee (something I've seen in some of my local grocery stores) for free, I figured what the heck? What resulted is a cup of coffee that is better than many of the average brands out there, but still not as good as the coffee that I brew at my bookstore job (when I work in the cafe).<br /><br />The scent of this coffee is great, so in that aspect it really didn't disappoint. It's also french press friendly, but then most coffees are. (But I thought I'd mention it since that's how I brewed my coffee.) I like my coffee strong, so I put more than the recommended amount & came out with a cup of coffee that was a little weaker than I generally like it.<br /><br />The taste of this is very good & is better than the Folgers coffee my mother gets (which I can either take or leave), FAR better than the shoddy Aramark coffee that is served at my full-time job (but then anything is better than that stuff), but not as good as the stuff that I make at the bookstore (my part-time job) or the Dunkin-Donuts brand coffee that a coworker makes. (He's got a specific way he makes it.) And compared to the pricey gourmet stuff my dad buys? This is swill in comparison. (But in all fairness, even my precious cafe coffee is swill in comparison. Like I said, my dad buys the good stuff.)<br /><br />Would I buy a bag of this product with my own money? Sure, if it was on sale in my local grocery store. It's a decent cup & I'm curious enough that I'd try some of the other flavors out there. Offhand though, I'd rather spend 8 to 12 dollars on a bag of the stuff at my bookstore job & drink that instead. Before buying bulk amounts of this coffee I'd recommend that any potential buyers purchase a bag at their local stores first. The price for three bags of this is decent (six dollars) since the bags of this go for about seven to eight dollars in my neck of the woods."

I prefer this type of coffee to the brands that are overly strong and have a burnt taste. Just make sure to follow the instructions on the bag for the amount of coffee per water. You can adjust more or less coffee based on your preferences. If you're making it as iced, use a little extra coffee. I'm glad I found this brand for a nice everyday coffee."

13200,B002TMV34E,A1SB9BNNGKNX2Z,Jim,0,0,5,1277251200,Makes a darn good cup of joe.*,"Classique Supreme is the second of the Melitta Gourmet Coffee Cafe Collection coffees I've tried. (I received free samples for review of the Classique Supreme and the Hazlenut Creme Brulee.) And I am quite pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />My coffee of choice to date, which I've been drinking for around 2 decades, is Peet's (which I get shipped to me as there are no Peet's outlets near me). Peet's sells several varieties which I like, and I always buy whole beans and grind them to make a cup at a time via a cone filter. When making coffee for 2 or 3 people I make each cup separately (using 2 or 3 cone filters at once). Also, I never drink straight coffee but always sweeten it (usually with honey) and add half & half (and sometimes French Vanilla International Delight).<br /><br />Melitta's Classique Supreme, as well as the Hazelnut Creme Brulee in the same line (and I assume all the varieties in their Cafe Collection line) are ground ""Extra Fine,"" and look to me to be finely ground enough to be used in an espresso maker (though I only make espresso - which I use in homemade lattes - with unflavored dark roasted coffees and the Classique Supreme is a medium roast). It looks and feels too finely ground to be used in a French Press (which I occasionally use for preparing coffee made from freshly ground beans, ground relatively coarse).<br /><br />So for testing/sampling purposes, I've been preparing the Classique Supreme (which I've drank several cups of over a couple of days) in a filter cone, using the exact measurements I use when preparing ground Peet's beans. And once I have sweetened and creamed the coffee to my taste, I cannot detect a difference in quality. The only difference I have noticed is that both varieties of Melitta's Cafe Collection that I've sampled leave me with less of an intense caffeine buzz than I typically get from the same size cup of Peet's (whether it's a medium or dark roast variety of Peet's). That's not necessarily a bad thing, for sometimes my second cup of coffee of the day (I usually drink 2 TALL cups a day) leaves me feeling a bit over-caffeinated (e.g., headachey or just off-kilter).<br /><br />The bottom line is that I like this coffee and given the relatively low price (e.g., at Amazon as well as Melitta's website), I'm motivated to try other varieties in Melitta's Cafe Collection line (particularly their darker roasts).<br /><br />I had difficulty opening both 11 oz. sample bags of Melitta Cafe Collection coffee I received - I found it impossible to open either bag without tearing holes in the upper half of each bag - so I called Melitta to comment about this. The customer service representative I spoke with said that Melitta recommends using scissors along the top of the bag.<br /><br />*(The phrase ""cup of joe"" supposedly came into vogue after Secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson, Josephus Daniels, banned alcohol aboard navy vessels in 1914, leaving coffee the strongest drink on navy ships.)"

Not only do we like coffee, but we know what we like and this isn't it.<br /><br />Flat bottom drip coffee makers use a medium grind to brew a perfect cup; while cone filtered drip pots can use a fine grind.  However this coffee is ground, according to the package, extra fine.  This type of grind is typically used in espresso machines, not drip coffee makers.  I have to wonder how much the grind affects the flavor of this coffee.<br /><br />The flavor is smooth, and non-acidic, while at the same time bland and forgetful.  We usually use a tablespoon of grounds per cup.  We tried the two teaspoons, as recommended on the package, which resulted in a weak cup of coffee.  Using our norm, the coffee had more flavor, but wasn't good.<br /><br />The only good thing about this coffee is using the used grounds in the garden.

I had my wife smell the can (oh, she LOVES being asked to smell-check gross stuff...actually, no).  She agreed with the horse shit description.  I put the remaining cans back on a high shelf far out of sight.<br /><br />When next I went to the grocery store (actually, Target I think) I got a couple cans of Green Giant sliced mushrooms and later when I used them on a pizza they smelled totally normal and free of ungulate diarrhea.  You can see in the attached image how one of my normal pizzas comes out...with normal mushrooms.<br /><br />So I'm highly disappointed...and it's left me feeling unsure of any Giorgio mushroom cans...and unsure about any organic mushroom cans...and just about canned mushrooms in general.  I like to use fresh when I have them (like, as I write this)...but most of the time when I make a pizza I use canned shrooms.  But I feel deeply scarred by this turd-infused experience and may have trouble trusting any canned mushrooms for a while.  Which is definitely going to cramp my style pizza-wise.  LAME!<br /><br />(In case anyone is wondering, this is not a joke, even if it may be funny to laugh at my stinky mushroom ordeal.  I lived it and I have the battle scars to prove it.)"

I would give these noodles a five stars if it weren't for the pre-preparation that is involved. I found these at my local Asian mart for about $2.00.<br /><br />First you must rinse these noodles well because the liquid they come in smells like a lake (you should prepare yourself for the smell). Second, you need to lay out the noodles on paper towels and press down removing as much of the liquid as possible before use.<br /><br />Next I fried them on high heat with a small amount of oil and butter. After a few minutes I then added my frozen stir-fry vegetable medley. I then added some broth, soy sauce, and finally a thickener such as corn starch. Stir it up, bring to a boil, and turn it off.<br /><br />Really it tasted great- very much like the ramen noodles.  It is important to note that the noodles themselves have ""no flavor"" and actually absorb the flavor of whatever ingredients you are cooking them in. So let them sit it whatever flavor suits you."
13282,B003H26J5I,A54LDOK42IASU,S. Cudjoe,23,23,5,1297382400,Tofu Shirataki Noodles,"I first heard about Shirataki noodles years ago and decided I would try it.  I went to Fiesta and got these Tofu Shirataki Noodle.  Shirataki are made from Konjac yams and the added tofu gives it a harder texture. The noodles without tofu added is 0 calories.  The one with tofu is 20 cal per 4 oz which is low in cal. I always rinse the noodles first. I never cook it longer than 3 minutes. The first time I ever made Shirataki Noodles I cooked it like regular pasta and it turned into a gel--this was years ago. I learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how I make these noodles. The next time I made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce. That didn't work for me, since the flavors did not merry and I was accustomed to the hard texture of pasta. The noodles are similar to the texture of vermicelli rice noodles. I personally prefer it in soups and not as a substitute for spaghetti.  I would sometimes eat it with a sauce I make with soy sauce, shredded ginger, chili paste, and sprinkle green onions on top for looks.  I have tried this rinsed without it being cooked and it has no flavor whatsoever.  It isn't like Ramen noodles which as a flavor without anything added.  Even though I still eat the Tofu Shirataki, I just got the one without tofu and it is very similar.  The one without tofu is 0 cal which is a plus.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I did some more research on Shirataki noodles in order to expand my ideas with recipes.  I found that the reason that my shirataki noodles may have turned into mush was because it expired.  It seems Shirataki noodles is still good for a year and even after it is still edible however it would turn to mush if cooked too long.  These noodles also apparently shrink and become thinner, something it seems some people like.  I went to the store that I used to get my Tofu Shirataki noodles, and looked at the for an expiration date.  Lo and behold, it was expired by over a year.  I even saw some in the store expired by over 2 years.  It seems that non expired shirataki noodles will become alot more chewy if cooked too long.  My mom used it in stir fry, and I have also tried it baked which is also a great idea.  I been lazy and not just use any boullion cube with the noodles and that works fine...I just let it sit in the seasoning for a few hours to take the flavor of the soup."

The plain Shirataki feel like a noodle shaped gummie candy when you eat them...not as hard but too 'slippery'..The House Brand with tofu didn't have that same 'slippery' taste. I didnt find preperation to be that bothersome as a couple of posters have mentioned. I just open them and pour them in a strainer and let the water run over them throughly, flipping them once or twice to get them rinsed well then I toss them in a pan of boiling water for about 15 seconds (they're already cooked) drain and season them however I wish. They have been a great addition to my low calorie diet. I just tried them last night with a packet of seasoning from a box of Suddenly Salad (classic) and I was in heaven...40 calories for the WHOLE bag!"

If you follow a low carb lifestyle, then House Foods Shirataki (Tofu) Noodles are heaven sent. I've been enjoying this product for well over a year and I'm so very happy to have found it. I heard about it on the Dr. Oz show and ran right out and bought some. I've tried the fettucine and spaghetti noodles also, but the angel hair is the most versatile. People who found them too rubbery probably did not follow the package directions. For best results, they have to be thoroughly rinsed and parboiled for at least three minutes. I am also amazed at how forgiving this product is. Once I got distracted and let the noodles simmer for almost 20 minutes and they STILL turned out fine. Maybe even better! If you want that ramen-like flavor do this: after parboiling and drying, saute them over high heat in a skillet with peanut oil and/or sesame oil, or hot chile oil. Add a few shakes of salt, onion & garlic powder and toss. Then just carry on with your recipe. They're very much like rice noodles so you won't miss a beat with stir-frys and noodle soups. I've also had great success with Italian dishes. I've used them with meatballs or Italian sausage in Marinara sauce. Also, with shrimp & scallops in a cream & wine sauce, just to name a few. Topped with grated, melted cheese, I got ALL of the joy and practically none of the carbs. However, one package really only serves one. This is an excellent, healthy alternative to pasta and noodles that will not wreak havoc upon your glycemic index. Good cooks will have no problem incorporating this into their menu planning."

However, if they tasted like regular pasta with only 40 calories a bag, I could deal. Unfortunately, they are disgusting. I am a big fan of the cookbook author/food blogger Hungry Girl, and she uses these all the time so I had to try them. Needless to say I was very disappointed. They were very chewy (she told her fans this, so I was prepared for it), smelled nauseating when I opened the bag (rotting vegetables or fish smell maybe?), and had a bizarre taste. Regular pasta just kind of works as a texture filler for dishes, but these noodles had a strong and weird, chalky flavor. I will NEVER, EVER buy them again and will just settle for eating pasta dishes made with whole wheat noodles only once in a while. If you still feel the need to try them, I'd recommend buying only one bag until you know whether or not they are for you."

I've tried several varieties of shirataki noodles, different shapes, with and without tofu and I like these ones best. The thicker ones just have a weird texture to me - too gummy and gelatinous. The angel hair ones come out very similar to thin rice noodles. They're pretty easy to use compared to cooking any pasta from dry.  Just give them a rinse and parboil for about 2 minutes and dry them off before putting them in whatever you're cooking. In my opinion, they do not work well in place of semolina pasta - they are much more like rice noodles with very little flavor of their own.  I especially like them in seafood curry stir-fry - masks any fishy smell that might still be on them."

Then I blot them dry and throw them on a microwaveable plate and microwave for 1 minute. I again blot all the excess water and microwave for one more minute. That way the noodles are cooked, the ""weird odor"" is completely gone, and the noodles are similar to al dente. I just dump whatever my sauce/concoction I made for the noodles over it and toss! If it seems time consuming with the microwave- think about waiting 12-14 minutes for pasta to boil- not to mention time for the water to come to a boil ;).<br /><br />I would buy these noodles in a HEARTBEAT on here, but that's just highway robbery to pay 10$ in shipping!!

I am puzzled how they can be sold and shipped since the front of the bag states ""perishable - keep refrigerated"".  I opened the bag and smelled the noodles, and they did have a rather strange, strong odor.  I immediate poured the noodles into a strainer and then rinsed them under cold water.  I put them in a sauce pan with a small amount of Lorivo expeller-pressed peanut oil and let them sit for a while, stirring occasionally.  I decided to add Guilin chili sauce, garlic powder, powdered ginger, a small amount rice vinegar, water, 3 - 4 tsp. coconut sap sugar and 1/2 large can drained bean sprouts.  I warmed this mixture for awhile - maybe 20 or more minutes.  It worked!  I created a palatable side dish with a good- tasting broth and appealing consistency.<br /><br />I served this side dish with broiled tuna, mahi mahi, and a Spring greens salad mix with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.<br />I wish that these noodles were available in larger sized bags at a lower price per serving, but $1 per person for two modest serving sizes per bag isn't outrageous unless you compare this with the cost of regular pasta.  I added the bean sprouts because the noodles alone didn't look like enough food for 3 people, and I thought that adding bean sprouts would offset any texture issues with the noodles. This recipe has now worked out twice with no real concern about cooking time for the noodles. Maybe the vinegar is the key, but the noodles are just like any other noodles when prepared this way and they make a great noodles with Asian-style broth meal or side dish.  And finally ... a use for those canned bean sprouts!<br /><br />Update:  I have now mixed these with baked tofu and Asian-style sauce. That combo worked out great.  Also I took the wide noodles, rinsed them and then put them in spaghetti sauce to simmer.  They tasted fine. Texture-wise, they will always be somewhat slimy and slippery and not al dente like well-prepared pasta, but otherwise, they worked out well. Just remember - just 40 calories - in an entire bag!

Very filling and only 40 calories. I am not much of a cook. I prefer the simplest of methods to cook. I rinse off quickly in cool water, then throw on a non-stick frying pan. I used to use Olive Oil but have found I don't need that, either. I sprinkle with Mrs. Dash or Vogue vegetarian chicken base. Just stir for a couple of minutes to get some of the water out. It's great. Last night I brought an unopened bag to a Cajun restaurant with me, and they agreed to cook with it in place of the traditional pasta that was supposed to come with my meal. The owner was surprised how much it tasted like pasta. For breakfast I sometimes use a little Almond Milk and Stevia for sweetener. I think they taste GREATTTTT, very very similar to pasta (unlike the shirataki without the tofu that isn't refrigerated and is more gel-like and not as similar to pasta). The product is great for your digestion and fills you up. I often stir-fry one and put into a plastic container with cooked vegetables and reheat for lunch. I'm addicted to House Foods Tofu Shirataki. However, if possible, search at your local grocery stores. The shipping online is expensive because it needs to be refrigerated. Highly recommend!!"

I started the Atkins diet and now that I never eat chips or pasta I have learned to get used to them, then I started really liking them. The first time I boiled them way too long and the recipe I made with them wasn't good. Just mix in RAGU and pour cheese on top and you have guilt free spaghetti. I even took Alfredo sauce which usually has like 3 carbs per serving? mixed that in there, fast, simple, and NO CARBS it's crazy. The fact that they are so guilt free made me have an acquired taste for them. Being that they are tofu, they would totally taste amazing fried up in stir fry, the texture would work well for that most definitely.

To prepare, I rinse well with hot water or drop in boiling water for a minute (best) the let dry. As for flavoring, I find these to work best in ""Soup"" applications with strong flavors. Like tofu, these will absorb whatever they are cooked in. My fave and easiest method is to simply sacrifice a $0.20 Run of the mill beef ramen, steal the flavor pack, and cook my noodles in the broth. I also add  Heinz reduced sugar ketchup to add body to the sauce and give it a lip smacking goodness. A bit frugal, but it is really good.

Perhaps not the exact same texture as a real flour based noodle, but for the calories and carb content these are excellent!<br /><br />As with any shirataki noodle, you do have to make sure you wash, wash and wash them some more. If there is any scent at all, you have not washed them enough. About 2 or 3 minutes seems to do the trick for me. I made a low carb peach kugel (dessert) with the fettuccine and a stir fry with the angel hair.

Gerber 2nds is vastly different from the other brands of 2nd baby foods that we have tried. The other brands seem to be similar in consistency. There is really no difference in the consistency of Gerber 1sts and 2nds. The difference is that 2nds includes turkey, chicken and beef and 1sts are all fruits and veggies. My baby did not find Gerber 2nds appetizing. The color and odor of the chicken is also nothing like actual chicken. I placed the lid back on the jar and refrigerated the jar since I was hoping to try it with her for another meal. The next day I got the Gerber 2nds jar from the fridge and reheated it. When it was reheated the food was so runny that she could have drunk it from a bottle. The consistency does not keep from one day to the next. If you're looking for a baby food with chicken, turkey, or beef then I would recommend that you try Beech Nut Stage 1. My baby loved the Beech Nut turkey, chicken, and beef. The only problem is that the major grocery stores in my area do not sell Beech Nut. Next trip that I make I plan to stock up on the Beech Nut!"

I've always snubbed Pill Pockets because of the expense - it was cheaper to bury medicines in pieces of hot dog, cheese, or bread or even burying it in peanut butter.  Stubborn Spike managed to figure all of these out though due to the strong scent of the medicine, and it made medicating him a nightmare.  As a last resort, I ordered Pill Pockets to give them a whirl.<br /><br />These really do make giving Spike his medicine so much easier!  In a week, he never turned his nose up or spit out medicine, and that means a lot less stress for this puppy mom.  Another reviewer said this and I figured I'd reiterate - they're a lot like chicken (or other meat, depending on your flavor) putty that's pre-shaped for capsules.  Spike's capsules (at 500mg each) were a little big for these pockets, but it was easy to shape around.  I know I'll be using these again rather than any other methods I've tried before."

He was going down the drain. Then I found this product. Simple as that, we put the medicine in the treat and he wolfed it down.

It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this). The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see). Our other dog (adult) did fine, however. Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google ""pill pockets diarrhea"", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.<br />Would suggest trying just one of these (or half of one) each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds."

When I read about this on-line, it says it is an infusion.  Other places both on-line and by the manufacturers say it is ""truffle-essence.""  There is a world of difference between these two things.  An infusion is easily the best way to try truffle oils, truly meaning that genuine truffles were infused with a high quality olive oil.  An ""essence"", on the other hand, generally means it's been made to taste of white-truffles, perhaps even using very synthetic methods.

I purchased a finger sprayer and use it to allow the oil to create a mist over simple dishes like ravioli/butter/capers/procusitto and parmesan.<br /><br />Most cooks are unaware that the product (infused olive oil) even exists. Used in the fashion above it can be misted in many recipes to add an exquisite taste at a reasonable price. Truffles can cost up to $400/lb making it an ingredient unavailable (unless purchased on line)and un-affordable.<br /><br />I am sure that I will return to buy more once my current supply exhasts.

Since I've never had white truffles before, I don't have much to compare them to, LOL.  But I wanted to try some white truffle oil, and this was affordable.  I'm planning to try some baked potato slices, and drizzle a bit on those (saw on TV cooking show). I tried it with some steamed clams, and it was ok.  If I find a use I really like for white truffle oil, I'll order again.  Prefer the black truffle salt I got at the same time."

I warmly encourage potential buyers first to google ""truffle oil""--you'll discover that there's no such thing. The ""truffle essence"" put in this and other truffle oils is a synthetic ingredient, whipped up in a lab, that mimics just one flavor of truffles. The aftertaste this (and any truffle oil) leaves is chemical. In order to make it work in a dish, you'll have cover it with garlic and other seasonings: basically, hide the flavor.<br /><br />There are some oils available through Amazon in which actual truffles are infused, but the problem is that oil doesn't easily absorb real truffle essence, so the presence of authentic truffle flavor is very weak and nearly undetectable.<br /><br />If you like this artificial flavor, then the price is right ($). But if you want real truffle flavor, get the real thing ($$$)."

Before purchasing this I was putting items directly onto my son's booster tray or using several small dishes, but this is a way better solution. There are seven deep wells, perfectly toddler-sized. I can put a few heaping spoonfuls of yogurt in one, some brown rice in another, diced squash, some chopped apple, steamed spinach.. a bit of this and a bit of that.

Something that also works are ice cube trays (if you don't have the ones with lids you can put them into a large baggie before putting in freezer or cover with aluminum foil) and spray the tray with Pam before filling.  It really does make it so that the frozen food pops right out.  The one nice thing about this tray over ice cube trays is that it freezes bigger cubes, but right now my baby only eats a little bit so smaller portions/cubes are actually better for now."

The 7 compartments can hold 2 oz each and the frozen food easily slips out of each compartment, thanks to the flexible silicone.<br />The only downside to this product, is that the plastic lid isn't airtight, despite claims that it is exactly that. Instead of the lid snapping onto the tray all around the edge and closing tightly, it only clicks into place in 5 different places, allowing air to get in and resulting in freezer burn. To prevent this I plastic wrap the tray before putting the lid on."

The only thing I don't like is that when I am freezing things that are more dense, like my homemade rice pudding, they are hard to push out when they are still in their frozen form.  When I freeze the same thing in a traditional ice tray, I don't seem to have that problem (I think because it is flexible rather than ridged, the tray flexes rather than releasing the food)...  things that are more watery like frozen juice are not as hard to get out.

I have twins and make a lot of organic food to freeze.  I freeze the food in the trays and then transfer then to FoodSaver bags so they never get freezer burned.  The one thing I HATE about the trays is that they have a weird, unpleasant odor to them.  The odor does not smell like the foods I stored in them.  For the most part, I wash them by hand. I tried soaking them in vinegar and figured the steam from the dishwasher might help, but nothing gets rid of the odor.  When I first got the trays, I had to run hot water over them to pop the food out.<br /><br />Now that I've been using them for a while, I can easily pop the food out without water.  I do try to transfer the food as soon as possible b/c the seal on the trays is not perfect and freezer burn can happen if you let them sit for too long.  I do feel the trays are overpriced.  I have 2 trays and could easily use 2-4 more to freeze the batches I make.  It's annoying to have to keep rotating the food to try to freeze it before it goes bad."

My husband and I both work and make our daughter's baby food instead of buying jars.  We make large batches on the weekends and having multiple trays allows us to make a variety of foods that we can then combine when defrosted during the week.  I love that they stack neatly in the freezer, have a lid (which a lot of other baby food trays don't have), and the frozen portions pop out easily.  Another reviewer wrote they use it as a serving tray for baby instead of many bowls--I will most certainly try that when baby is ready to feed herself.<br /><br />As a tip...the lid isn't completely airtight (as other mentioned) so I wouldn't recommend leaving the food in the tray until you're ready to serve.  We pop food portions out after freezing over night and store in labeled bags.  This is very handy for grabbing foods quickly."

It is soft and rubbery so I am able to push up from the bottom of the mold to remove the food. I don't like having to run hot water over the back, like I have to with my other molds, because I don't like tap water getting on the food. (I'm a little obsessive, compulsive) Just make sure not to fill the molds all the way to the top because the food expands and then you'll have food on the lid. Makes for easier cleaning if you don't get food on the lid."

The price is insane for what is essentially a glorified ice cube tray, which does not work as well as your basic ice cube tray. It's difficult to get the cubes out of this tray, it has an odd shape that wastes space in your freezer, and it makes 2 ounce servings, which are fine if you know you want 2 ounces, but I prefer to make 1 ounce sizes so that I can combine different flavors, or make just 1 (or 3) ounces if my baby is not as hungry and I don't want any waste. The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because of the lid - that IS handy, I must admit. But you can buy ice cube trays with lids too, that will actually fit in your freezer and stack well.

Im glad that I had the gift card to go towards this product because I know that it is very expensive. here are the reasons that I enjoy this product:<br /><br />1) I use it often, every 3-6 days. If I think about it like that then I feel like Im really getting my moneys worth<br />2) The silicone makes it not only easy to clean and durable but a breeze to pop food out without having to worry about breaking the device<br />3) I like that it has a lid, and for the most part I really feel like they did the best that they could to make the lid fit on properly and snuggly<br />4) The size of the cubes are perfect for my needs. they are a good helping size and I never need to feed my baby anymore at one sitting. I dont waste a lot of food, if any, and my baby doesnt leave wanting more<br /><br />suggestions to this product and its use:<br /><br />1) I have a small freezer, its not standard size and therefore things freezer burn in my freezer at double the rate. Due to this issue that has nothing to do with the product, I overfill these cubes so that the top is touching the lid and no freezer burn is able to form before I can transfer them over into a freezer bag<br />2) because the cubes are bigger I thaw them out the night before in my refridgerator so that by midday they are thawed all the way through and i can easy heat the food evenly from there.<br /><br />I gave this a four instead of five stars simply because they could have devised a snap lock lid system for the money they are charging and made this an overall outstanding item and also because the price point is a little high, Im sure that its not even close to that much money to put together some silicone! i think baby items should be reasonably priced so that even those that are a little less fortunate can enjoy quality baby products such as a way to freeze food."

Yes, you can use ice cube trays to freeze baby food & other things but these are so much more convenient for me since they're = a jar of baby food, plus the reason I really love them is that I have continued to use them all the time after we were done with purees. I have 19 month old twins & made all their purees & continue to make a lot of their food and freeze things ahead for easy defrost & prep at the end of my work day when we get home & they're starving.  I'm not sure why another person was trying to scoop the portions out with a spoon (?) but all you have to do is run hot water over the back side for about 30 sec and everything pops out no problem. I have the same issue w/ ice cube trays so I don't really understand the issue others have reported.<br />So, in addition to purees, I have frozen things like the following in these to = 1/2 or full portion sizes for my kids (depending on how old they were, obviously I need to defrost more of them as they get older): risottos, ground beef/turkey, small meatballs & sauce, mac & cheese, small portions of elbow macaroni (when they were younger & couldn't eat as much), and anything else really that can be smooshed into the container. These are things that would not work in an ice cube tray & freezing in a million containers or one big one is not practical, at least for me.<br /><br />It's too bad they're not a little more affordable but I do think they're great."

I could use a second one but at this price I'll make due with the one I've got."

Later on I tried the Raddish mix from the sprout house and they seem to be doing fine. But this mix no matter what I do,  i.e., watering more number of times, keeping in dark place etc didn't help.  I guess either I got the seeds from a bad batch or they are too old stock. I tried to see weather I can contact them from my orders, but could not figure it out.  I am giving 3 stars thinking the pack I got from a bad batch. I didn't bother try to return as I used up half of the pack during this tryouts."

13518,B0001W2W62,A17771LTRWSKQ5,Helen S. Lam,2,2,4,1331078400,Great mix,"The seeds came in a plastic bag with a baggie tie.  About 90% of the seeds germinated.  This mix is a bit spicy if eaten alone.  However, it tastes great when eaten with other vegetables or in a sandwich.  One of my new favorite ways to eat these sprouts is add a spoonful of hummus to the sprouts.  It adds flavor and cuts the spiciness of the sprouts.  Give it a try!  I top my salads with these sprouts as well.<br /><br />I used 3 tablespoons of this seed mixture to sprout in the Easy Sprout.  My house is coolish in the winter (55F - 65F) so I put the Easy Sprouter in the oven which is a bit warmer than the rest of the house.  If you need to make it even warmer, turn on the oven light to add a bit more heat!  NEVER turn on the oven itself as that would cook the seeds and melt your Easy Sprouter!<br /><br />Here are my sprouting steps for my sprouter:<br /><br />1.  Since there are small alfalfa seeds in this mix, put in the small-slit insert to the inner slit cup to prevent these seeds from washing out.  Put the inner cut into the outer cup.  Soak 2 - 3 tablespoons of seed in the sprouter for 12 hours.  Put on the slit dome cap to allow aeration.  Put the sprouter in the oven for a warmer environment if needed.  Otherwise, leave it on the kitchen counter.  (You do not need light for sprouting.)<br /><br />2.  Pull out the inner cup (with the slits) to drain out the water. Turn on the faucet to give the seeds a ""shower"" and allow the water to drain out completely.  Shake the inner cup and tap it against the sides of the sink to drain out all water.  Put the inner cup back into the outer cup (solid cup without slits).  Put back on the slit dome and put the sprouter back into the oven.<br /><br />3. Repeat #2 every 12 hours for about 4-5 days.  It's necessary to give your sprouts showers to wash off any potential mold and to maintain moisture around the seeds.<br /><br />5. On the last day, you can also put your sprouter near in indirect light to get some greening of the leaves.  It's not necessary but it sure is pretty to see the little green leaves on the sprouts.<br /><br />6. To store your sprouts, just take off the dome lid and put on the vented lid.  It'll keep for about a week or so.<br /><br />For videos and recipes, check out SproutPeople."

Just be forewarned.<br /><br />Also, start small!  These produce a LOT of sprouts.  I started with about a tablespoon and that was plenty for the grower I used."

I can't always say a product is green just because it is green on the label; lots of manufacturers dupe consumers into buying ""natural"" products that aren't any healthier than the feline equivalent of a Snickers bar.  But after reading the label, I can't say I seriously knock this manufacturer. The ingredients look pretty good.  Can't say Amazon is the best place to buy these treats, though.  I saw em for 3.99 at another website.  So shop around, but when you get a good deal on these treats, buy them.  Your kitties will thank you.  And follow you all around the house begging loudly."

I first tried adding 1/4 teaspoon to a small serving of scrambled eggs, and could detect nothing.  Today I made a 'two egg' (1/2 cup of eggbeaters) omelet flavored with tarragon and filled with simple sauteed potatos, scallions, and mushrooms.  I drizzled on a full teaspoon of the 'truffle oil' after the omelet was set, immediately before filling and folding it.<br /><br />Again, I could discern no flavor or aroma other than the above ingredients.

There are like 25 different names for MSG- or free glutamate-containing substances, and they just hide it under a different name  (Google ""Other Names for MSG"" and you will be appalled).  Unfortunately the FDA does not require any real disclosure on labels - MSG can also be labeled simply as ""spices"" or ""natural flavors.""  It's safe to go ahead and assume that any flavor base seasoning such as that used here will have some type of MSG in it.  If another processed product such as flavor base is used in creating a new product, the ingredients in the component product (e.g., flavor base)are not required to be disclosed on the label.

My dog started gagging and then vomitted.  She ate it at about 4pm and got sick around 10pm.  Slept through the night, although she woke me up a few times, and was still licking her mouth and gagging the next morning.  I don't know if it's because the bone is really rich and she's not used to it, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's a product you and your dog are already familiar with as it was our experience that it made our dog ill.<br /><br />If you do purchase this product, definitely make sure you watch your dog with it - if they're eating it too fast, consider taking it away so they don't devour the entire thing in 10 minutes like ours did."

These are not durable and go away within an hour or two, but they are meant to. These are not meant to be for a teething puppy or for a chew toy that lasts. These are supposed to be super special treats that you give your dog once in a blue moon (Like if you are leaving to go on a trip). Yes, they are expensive, but for a reason. They are made in the U.S. and for those of you that do not know, it is healthier to get treats from the U.S. if you can. They are also healthy. One Dentastix is about 300 calories and I read many reviews saying it gave their dog diarrhea and made them sick. Yes there is a review saying this made their dog sick, but he probably ate it too fast. Your dog may need to be watched while eating these. These are meant for a treat and not a bone that lasts.

The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, ""natural,"" flavored bones and thought.... ""SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!"" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great."

Great.  It's a little pricey, but I have a teething 5 month old puppy who has recently been spayed; she can't get her regular course of exercise so I bought this as a nice treat to help keep her occupied in her restless state.  I took it away from her (mad dog!) after 45 minutes.  Just one end was left.  I had bought her the largest ""souper"" size.  After reading the other reviews, I count myself lucky that she got that much time out of it.  Yes it's a ""treat"", but at $6, it's a treat I cannot afford to give her very often.  Health wise it's not a treat I could make a habit of feeding often; I feel I have to give my puppy less dinner tonight to make up for the large amount of calories she just wolfed down.  I hope that it doesn't make her sick as it did another reviewer's dog.  I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it, break up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out.

I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist).  It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to 'clean up' the mess.  If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product.  It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.<br /><br />I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).<br /><br />My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I can't justify it."

So you may see it twice -- YES, I did order BOTH products.<br /><br />1) This product comes COLD packed in a wine brine with onions (as was expected) - read this next part carefully:<br /><br />This is a cold product - IT MUST BE SHIPPED and KEPT REFRIGERATED, because it has no preservatives.<br /><br />Make certain you have ROOM in your fridge for the jar(s) which are slightly different than the one pictured (thinner diameter straight wide-mouth jar and taller, which makes then easier to fit in the fridge).<br /><br />2) If you don't normally consume this product in this form (packed in wine sauce) then don't buy it. It would probably be considered to be an ""acquired taste"" by most. Buy a small jar in a local grocery first to try. If you like it then order this larger jar.<br /><br />3) This brand does appear to have a stronger fish taste (up against the brine), than other brands I have tried. The fish taste is stronger on the thick cut product, which may be preferred, depending on your tastes. My guess is that would diminish over time while marinating in the ""wine"" and onion based brine.<br /><br />4) I suggest that you might try just one jar at a time. Remember IT MUST BE KEPT REFRIGERATED -- it can NOT be stored without being refrigerated in a pantry.<br /><br />5)This brand is pricey with shipping costs. You may be able to purchase locally if you don't require Canadian packed herring.<br /><br />6) Eating fish may be good for you, and if you like this type of product, it might be an easy way to consume larger amounts of Omega fats other than downing supplements. You could live longer, but you will need to brush your teeth or chew gum more, or you may become an old person with fish breath. ;)<br /><br />Finally I should note that this was the second shipment sent, but I never saw the first box which I was told was damaged during delivery.

I had tried acai berry drinks before and aren't crazy about their flavor, and this doesn't change that. This product has a taste that reminds me of Chinese medicine. White tea is already by itself very subtle. The combination of white tea, lemonade, and acai juice just doesn't work together. I also found it overly sweetened (28g sugar in the bottle). One bottle is 140 calories.<br /><br />In addition to white tea, acai juice, cane sugar and lemon juice, it has soy lecithin. It's a common food additive, but I'm not sure what it's doing in a tea. Maybe to keep the lemon and acai mixture from separating out. That's nothing a good shaking can't fix.<br /><br />The bottle is too nice to throw out, so I'll reuse it for my own beverages.

After waiting nearly 4 weeks for them to arrive I finally contacted Amazon to let them know that I still had not received the cookies I ordered.  Two days later the cookies arrived - where they went before reaching me is still a mystery.  But I was happy to finally have them as I can't get them in Southern California.  The minimum order was 4 packages and that was okay, I would freeze some for later.  Much to my dismay the supplier just put the four bags of cookies and a box with NO packing to protect them.  So you guessed it....almost all of the cookies were broken into crumbs:  And to top it off the cookies ""best if eaten by date"" was only 2 days after I received them!  Needless to say these must have been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time.  After contacting Amazon I was able to get a refund for my crushed cookies.  Oh well, maybe I will try again by ordering with Amazon through a different vendor. Thank you Amazon - you were great."

These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.""<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />""The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.""<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />""On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.""<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook ""nutritional epidemiology"", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book ""Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."""

Yet Another Saffron Review,"If you purchase saffron then chances are you have encountered at least one of my other saffron reviews. I've tried most of it from Amazon after finding it exceptionally difficult to purchase decent saffron in my small town. Unfortunately, nothing replaces the truly exceptional delight that is pure saffron so my search for superior saffron continues.<br /><br />There we no other reviews on this and I was a bit hesitant to purchase an entire 1 ounce tin especially from the Roland brand name which is often associated with imports from China. The description did not even indicate if this saffron was from Spain or not but the price was ultra-right (also somewhat suspect since it was such a good price).<br /><br />First, set your mind at ease...this saffron is indeed from Spain rather than the often inferior products from elsewhere. It comes sealed in a plastic bag inside a decorative tin but even at that, the aroma was clearly evident before opening the shipping box.<br /><br />As for the quality of the saffron. It's good but not great. To test, I make a standard dish and compare the quantity required to bring it to the right level of taste...it required more than that of the Frontier brand of Saffron (very fresh but the selection of packaging requires it to ""air out"" due to lingering odor from plastic liner) but not nearly as much as some of the other dried little sad saffron selections I've encountered in local grocery stores or even via ordering here online.<br /><br />The actual touch/texture also denotes a fair level of freshness rather than the dry stubble of inferior brands but wasn't quite as supple as I'd normally desire.<br /><br />Fragrance - very nice and aromatic.<br /><br />Overall - for the price, I'm very pleased. It will not be my first choice on the finest dishes BUT it does provide a very solid option for general use with a price that won't make me cringe.<br /><br />On a side note, Amazon and/or the Roland brand ran a special promotion for an additional percentage off all Roland products...combined with the subscribe and save option this was the best price per ounce I've EVER encountered for true Spanish saffron. Keep an eye out for guilt free, affordable saffron you can use in any dish rather than having to save for special dishes only."

Other than my taste preference desiring a bit more spice (a couple dashes of hot sauce would do the trick), I thought this soup was good.

Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4."

I'm not the biggest fan, but sometimes I'm kind of hungry and these pack way more protein than the average fatty snack. The only problem is the type of fat it's fried in--melted pig fat from the skin itself! Not particularly healthy, but it's much healthier than the mexican bagged varieties.<br /><br />Since we don't have a microwave (oh my god, how do we get by without one?!), we toast them in a toaster oven on a baking tray for about 10-15 minutes at 375F-400F. They come out great. If you lean closer to 10 minutes, you get a crunchy-porky tasting snack, while if you go past 15, you'll get the typically super-puffed pork rind you'd expect from Cardenas.

I find in my fairly powerful microwave that i have to run a small plate of the condensed pieces (as they're shipped) for at least 1:45 (package says try 90 seconds to start) and I don't think it's my imagination that after these are taken out of the nuke chamber, they start to contract a bit.<br />But, when you consider that you can get a fresh, hot plate of puffy rinds in very short order, these are well worth the price. Of course you can get a trash-bag full of rinds at warehouse stores and other venues for a couple few bucks but for fresh eating at home, the only thing I'd compare these to is fryin' up a batch and these are hugely more convenient.<br />On a 10 point scale, I'd give these a 7 but on the Zon's 5 star system, I have to go with 4."

A little while later you have perfectly seasoned pork rinds nicely salted. If you want to add a little flavor, a bit of hot sauce does wonders.<br /><br />I would like to warn you however you need a certain wattage microwave. I originally tried in a 700W microwave and I got partially popped pork rinds which looked like crackling/pork rind hybrids and tasted horrible. I'm not sure what the minimum wattage would be, but a 1200W microwave made perfect pork rinds. I would suggest you put your first batch in, set it for 5 minutes, but then watch the batch closely to get the proper timing down for your microwave. Adjust slightly for larger and smaller batches.<br /><br />For alternatives to the microwave I also tried using the oven which works but takes more time than I'd like.

I heated some lard in my fryer and tossed the under-cooked ones into the hot fat.  They puffed some more, and some of them were edible.  Then, I put a few of the uncooked chips in the fryer, and finally I had the pork skins I was hoping for! Hot, puffed, crispy, delicious.

Inital try had many unpuffed  pieces, and the pieces that puffed, had rock hard ends.  Microwaves pretty much work by heating the water in your food, so if the amount of humidity in your pork rinds is too low, they won't heat up enough to puff.  I took about 1/4th of a paper towel, wet it and lightly squeezed out the excess so it was not dripping wet, then put it in the bag with the pork pellets overnight.  The next day, the paper towel was dry, so I guess that the rinds absorbed the extra moisture.  When I tried to cook them again, they puffed up much much better and in less time.  There were only two or three unpuffed pieces, and one or two rock hard ends.  I also got good results by soaking them in water right before microwaving, but the papertowel method is easier with less mess.  Just be carefull that you don't make the inside of the bag too humid then you may have to worry about spoilage."

It turns out that that big green body on this tool is just filled with a spring and a rod, and you can't load it with cheese.  You can only fit enough cheese into a very small chamber for about one olive.  So you have to fill this little chamber with cheese by hand, and then it presses it into the olive.  Then you have to do it all over for your next olive.  You might as well just stuff the olive my hand instead of stuffing the stuffer.  It's kind of a weird concept.

And you won't find me sipping a double mocha cinnamon latte that costs half a paycheck.  As far as I'm concerned espressos are for those shoppers with ten items or less.  Just pour me a cup of rich, hot coffee, brewed in a Mr. Coffee or a Bunn.  And if the coffee being brewed is FOLGERS CLASSIC ROAST GROUND COFFEE, I know I'm going to enjoy every drop.<br /><br />Folgers, an American fixture in kitchen pantries for generations, boasts about its mountain grown coffees.  I know this because Mrs. Olsen told me (and you oldtimers will know what I'm talking about).  Thing is, there's nothing better in the morning than waking up to the rich aroma of Folgers Classic Roast brewing in the coffee maker; it's one of the most recognizable aromas to stir the olfactories.  Folgers makes a variety of blends, but I prefer the Classic Roast; as a lifelong Folgers drinker the classic is the same brand I enjoyed as a young whippersnapper.  Yet on the high tech side, Folgers has the unique interlocking AromaSeal that preserves freshness. . .sans can openers.  The easy grip handles are pretty. . .handy, too.<br /><br />So pay through the noggin for lima bean espresso if that floats your boat; I'll take my can of FOLGERS CLASSIC ROAST GROUND COFFEE, thank you very much.

Sherwin,4,6,5,1238284800,all right by me !!!,"I was in a local supermarket one day when I noticed several ladies flocking into the coffee aisle and throwing eight or nine canisters at a time of Folgers Classic Roast coffee into their shopping carts! As it turns out, the coffee was on sale; and the customers wanted to ""stock up"" on it. I asked one of these customers about Folgers and she swore that it was the best coffee out there. I then tried it myself--and wow, those people sure were right!<br /><br />Folgers Classic Roast Ground Medium coffee can be made in any coffee pot or coffee maker and the seal on the top of the canister helps to keep the ground coffee fresh. The coffee is consistently tasteful and it gives you a great, good tasting pick-me-up in the morning.<br /><br />The directions are simple enough: Use roughly one tablespoon of Folger's ground coffee to make one six fluid ounce serving of coffee. I use two tablespoons full when I want a mug full of coffee to start my day. In addition, you probably should refrigerate the canister after you open it; but I leave the canister on my kitchen countertop or even in a kitchen cabinet and the coffee still tastes great. If you can catch a sale on this terrific coffee I would suggest that you stock up. You can even put the unused canisters in your freezer for up to several months, maybe even a year. It will stay fresh and taste every bit as good after you let it defrost.<br /><br />Only one cautionary note that you probably already figured anyway--don't drink this if you are sensitive to caffeine. Consult your doctor if your stomach or your system is sensitive to anything that contains caffeine before you drink this coffee. Folgers also makes decaffeinated coffee that is quite good; I've tried it.<br /><br />Folgers also makes this coffee at what they call different ""roast levels,"" or what we would probably call ""strengths."" You can choose from mild, medium, medium-dark and dark. I usually see just medium and medium-dark on the grocer's shelf. Amazon offers the medium strength of the coffee which what I personally prefer.<br /><br />All in all, Folgers is far and away the best coffee on my grocer's shelf and it should remain extremely popular for some while to come. It costs a bit more than some other brands of coffee but it's worth every penny you'll spend on it. You won't be disappointed!"

If you're looking for the butter, crispy or chewy skin, and deep fried flavor components, then you won't have those here. I don't buy beef jerky anymore (which is also a favorite), I buy these!

The white truffle presence in Bartolini is weak with mineral (almost chemical) notes, not the earthy, warm and almost intoxicating fragrance you expect from white truffles.<br /><br />There is no such thing as white truffles (oil or otherwise) on a budget.  The real thing is expensive, a deserving price for the experience you expect."
13970,B000793XK8,A2N96A168YW2C3,Kate H,2,3,5,1290816000,By far the best truffle oil available,"I've read a whole lot of reviews for the various different brands of truffle oil, a number of which suggest that there is no way of infusing truffle flavor into the oil, and that all are full of chemicals.  Well, I can't comment knowledgeably on that, but I can say that the Bartolini brand is by far the best that we have tried, and tastes and smells strongly of truffle.  We use this primarily as a finishing oil, on risotto and scrambled eggs, where the quality of the underlying oil is critical, and have been really happy with the Bartolini oil.  I first used this product when living in London, and had friends bring some out for me when I hadn't been able to find a good alternative in the US, so am delighted to find this on Amazon.<br /><br />The oil is a bright yellow, and the base oil smells like a good quality extra virgin oil.  Each bottle at least has a small piece of truffle in the bottom, lending some support at least to the idea that the oil is infused.  If there is artificial flavor added, as some reviewers have suggested there has to be, then all I can say is that the resulting taste certainly doesn't have a chemical, or artificial taint, unlike some other brands we have tried.<br /><br />In particular, we have also used the Tourangelle brand, available in a tin from Amazon and Whole Foods, which is absolutely ghastly, and the quality of the oil used for that brand is appalling.  The end product is pale, tasteless and almost without any aroma, let alone that of truffles.  The presentation in a tin is unattractive and also lends the oil a somewhat metallic taint...just a generally awful product.  I guess they realize that the product looks so bad that if they put it in glass they'd never sell any of it.  Perhaps they think people are going to use it as a cooking, rather than a finishing oil, which is completely inappropriate....you could hope that heating it may burn off the dreadful chemical taint!<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a good option, that looks and smells good on the food, and at least gives the impression that it is a natural oil, I don't think you can go past this product."

I tried to break it up for my little dog, but it was hard as a rock and I wasn't about to try and hack it with a knife so I just gave it to her as-is. This is the only reason I'm deducting a star because the ingredients are great and they are good treats but sometimes a full sized treat is too much for a small dog.<br /><br />We have a 4 year old, 9lb mutt who is REALLY picky and not very food motivated.  She has been known to turn her nose up at fish if not prepared to her liking and has literally spit out most grocery store purchased dog treats - especially if they require any effort to actually crunch them to eat. It's like she can't remember that she has the capacity to eat hard foods, so she'll let a bowl of her (very expensive) dog food sit out for 24 hours before remembering how her jaw works.<br /><br />So. Needless to say I was surprised when she took this treat from my hands and ran off to another room with it.  In the other room, she sat and inspected it and played with it for about a minute before she was struck with the idea to try and eat it. Normally this is when she leaves the treat in the middle of the room and comes back to me to see if I'm going to give her the real treat - usually some kind of jerky - but to my surprise, she ate the whole thing.  And when she was done she ran back to where we were and sat in front of the bag.  Waiting.  This has never happened with a dry treat before so I have to assume that's a sign of approval from a pleased dog.  I gave her a second one, which she hid under her blanket for about 3 minutes before coming back to it to eat.<br /><br />In Amazon's 6 pack it breaks down to about $3.25 for each package.  Compared to the biscuit treats I had tried before with similar ingredients that my dog rejected, this is on par with the pricing.  It's more expensive than treats I'd find in normal grocery store aisles or at the big pet store chains, but about the same price as the stuff I normally get at specialty pet stores.  It's way cheaper than the duck jerky I had been buying, but those are two totally different types of treats so I can't compare the two and this will not replace my dog's duck treats.  The biggest selling point for me is that I have to go to a specialty pet store to find the other biscuit treats with the same kind of ingredients so being able to order this in bulk on Amazon makes it a much sweeter deal."

Usually with dry treats my dogs will sniff them and give you a look of ""Ok, this is nice, but where's the dried chicken or duck jerky?"" and only eat them after realizing that there's nothing else coming. With the Newman's Own, they sniffed them once and immediately started chowing down without so much as a ""What else ya got?"" look.<br /><br />While these treats are amazing and made with 95% organic ingredients, there are a few caveats. First they are very, very dry and hard. Each treat is made up of two squares, made to be breakable down the center scoring if you wanted to divide the treat up. Each square is approximately 1""x1"". Breaking apart the squares will help release a little of the odor of the biscuits - after the first time I gave the dogs these treats, they started snubbing them a bit until I would break a piece off. I think that perhaps the outer portion of the snack gets dried out and no longer has any smell that the dogs can detect (or it's really faint). Once you break them apart, the dogs recognize the smell and eat it up. Since they are so hard however - if you have an older dog with teeth issues, this is probably not the best treat for them.<br /><br />Second, since the snack is so dry, it is very crumbly. If you have a dog that only eats the chunks and never cleans up the crumbs, you'll have a mess to deal with every time they eat these. As my dog breaks apart the treat, it deteriorates into several pieces including minute crumbs. My dogs generally lick the floor until everything's picked up, but if you have a plush carpet, this might be something to consider.<br /><br />Other than that, my dogs love these treats and I'll probably be picking up more in the future."

Our dog didn't say anything about this treat, but he did gobble it up heartily. Then again, he gobbles up any treat I give him. I can't say I noticed anything different about his reaction to this treat than compared to, say, Milk Bones, except it takes him longer to eat these (they are hard). The makers leave it up to the dog owners to know or assume the benefits of this treat, because it doesn't say what they are on the bag. The bag lists a lot of features, like Organic, No Wheat, No Corn and Baked in Small Batches, but it doesn't say why these things are beneficial. The back of the bag has a fictional story about Newman's dog rumored to be writing a Tell All book. I assume it must appeal to Newman's target audience, and I'm not in that audience. Maybe it's just the marketing consultant in me, but I think it would be useful to list the benefits as well as the features."

After receiving treats for two days both panel members would return from the yard immediately when the bag was shaken and they were called - high praise indeed from this pair.<br /><br /> These treats are quite hard and did require that some chewing  occur rather than their usual practice of swallowing things whole which I considered a plus as it would help clean their teeth to some extent.

To test this I offered these treats to my cats, and although both expressed interest in them neither were able to bite into the treats.<br /><br />I liked this product, both my dogs were happy with the treats (although to be fair neither one has ever been picky).

Read on, I'll explain later.<br /><br />The first thing I did when I received the Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley Treats was to read the lable.  Darn near everything is listed as organic.  Whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal opinion and personally, I don't even look for organic food for myself.  Is organic food actually healthier?  I don't know, but for the purposes of this review, that's neither here nor there.  The treats themselves are hard and crunchy and about 1"" x 2"" in size.  Each is scored so they can be broken in half.  I preferred to break them in half for all my dogs even though none would have had issues with the size.<br /><br />My house seems to revolve around my 4 rescued dogs, 2 Australian Kelpie mixes, a Yellow Lab mix, and a beautiful Heinz 57, maybe a doberman/border collie mix.  Weights run from 30 lbs to 85 lbs.  At one point in their lives, all of them had been abused and I do know for a fact that 2 had been starved.  As a result none are too picky about dog food or treats.  When presented with the Newman's treats for the first time 3 dogs took them quickly, but not as quickly as usual.  One dropped the treat and sniffed it before eating it.  My lab spent about 15 seconds sniffing before she would take it.  When given their regular brand of treats, the lab usually sniffs for just a second before taking it and the others just grab and inhale them.  At another treat time each dog was presented with 2 treats side by side on the floor, one of the Newman's and one of their regular brand.  Two dogs, including the hesitant Lab, chose their regular brand first before eating the Newman's.  The 2nd time I tried that, 3 out of four at their regular brand first.  That pretty much ended the experimentation and I just gave the Newman's treats until they were gone. One of the Kelpies actually refused the Newman's a couple of times which for him was highly unusual since he's usually the first in line at treat time. The others never did seem overly excited about eating organic but did eat them.  When we changed back to the usual brand they scarfed them down as usual.<br /><br />Now we get to the ""four ears up"".  When my four are really excited about something they will sit at full attention with their ears completely perked up.  At the treat times when they were being fed the Newman's, they initially started out with perked ears then once they found out what they were getting, their excitement faltered and they seemed somewhat indifferent.  Since there are four dogs with 2 ears each, an ""8 ears up"" would be a perfect rating where they were excited about eating or doing something.  Since, with the 2 exceptions, they never did refuse the Newman's but ate them without much excitement, these treats get a ""four ears up"" rating, pretty much middle of the road.<br /><br />If feeding your dogs organic treats is important to you, definately give thee a try.  Just be forewarned that they may be a bit on the large side for small dogs and they do seem harder and crunchier than some other brands.  Given the cost and the lackluster response from my dogs, it's highly unlikely that I'll be giving them the Newman's in the future."

Our dogs are around 15-20 pounds and I think these dog treats are a little bit too hard for them.  The first time we tried to feet these treats to them they turned up their noses. They were absolutely NOT interested at all.  The next time we tried they carried them around in their mouths for a minute or so, and decided, for some reason, that they were inedible.  However, the third try must have been when they were REALLY hungry because they appeared more interested. But this is more like rawhide than a ""treat"". Our dogs really had to work on this for a long time. Our younger dog, a Shih Tzu did okay and after about 15 minutes was making headway on eating it.  Our elderly Japanese Chin who is 14 (that's 98 in dog years) was  much more fussy.  She seemed interested for awhile and even though she still has all her teeth, she just couldn't be enticed to do much more than sniff it. Perhaps a larger dog would like these better. I haven't given up on ""Newman's Own"" brand but I doubt that I'll try their New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Biscuits (made with lamb and barley)again."

They are scored so you can break them into squares. They are very dry, crunchy treats.

The variables:<br /><br />1) I have two Lhasapoos (mixed breed), almost 13 yrs old, with healthy teeth.<br />2) One is 13 lbs & one is 11 lbs, comparable in size to a large (not fat) house cat.<br />3) They are fed dry dog food, which is left in a feeder, so they eat whenever they like -- even so, they only eat small amounts.<br />4) When they are given a ""treat,"" it's not all the time, and they receive either a dog biscuit or a raw-hide stick -- never people food.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the Newman treats didn't smell any differently than their usual dog biscuits, and I was concerned with the large size. I noticed they had an indentation in the middle, but only a few biscuits were easy to break in half; most of them were just too hard to snap -- and I have strong hands...I can't imagine someone with arthritis being able to break one of these in half. The Newman treats are a great size for a bigger breed, like a golden retriever, for instance.<br /><br />I put the Newman biscuits in the same canister that I use for other treats, even though the bag is resealable. I wasn't sure if the bag would affect my dogs' reactions to a new treat. By the way, I did read all the ingredients on the bag & it all looked healthy to me. I didn't see a reason why the dogs wouldn't like the treats.<br /><br />I gave them half a piece each, after their morning potty break; they do not eat at night because they sleep in our bedroom with the door closed. They appeared very excited until the pieces were in their mouths, and then both dogs spit the pieces out & stared at me like I just tried to feed them dirt. I told them, ""you're not getting anything else for a treat,"" and walked away; they reluctantly ate the pieces. Over the past week or so, I've given them a whole biscuit every other day. They always eat them, but they don't wolf them down (no pun intended, really) they way they do with their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBIP5W"">Milk-Bone Biscuits for Small Dogs</a>.<br /><br />Perhaps it is a texture issue? Too bad my dogs can't tell me...not to give TMI, but I am the one who does ""poop patrol"" in the backyard & the biscuits don't seem to have affected the consistency or size of the poop. (Look, I don't normally review dog food -- I'm not sure what other dog owners would be concerned about LOL)<br /><br />Anyway, I don't recommend this product for dogs under 25 lbs, or dogs with weak teeth or dental problems that could affect crunching-ability."

I also keep chickens and it occurs to me that for a little protein boost, this would be a fun way to treat them too.  I'd have to soak them for awhile but I think they will also be getting a treat.<br /><br />The only thing I would like to see added is another version of this treat that includes glucosamine.  My dog has severe hip dysplasia and we supplement him with glucosamine twice a day.  He doesn't love the pills and administering them is not a fun job, but because we can tell a different when he's on them, we persevere.  However a treat like this that he wolfs down, that includes the glucosamine?  Now THAT I would be willing to pay good money for.

It is quite dry and hard (and does not break into a smaller size very easily), so it doesn't have a greasy, meaty appeal that gets both of my dogs excited.

Lucy - the 8-year-old rescue beagle we took in, who is pickier about her chow, but can sniff out anything food related from 4-feet away (she could have a career sniffing out illegal food in luggage, seriously).<br /><br />The test method was to hold 1/2 of a Newman's treat in one hand and a Milkbone in the other. First we let them smell our hands with the treats inside our fists. Then we did the switcheroo behind our back and put them out in open palms.<br /><br />Both dogs preferred the smell of Newman's after breakfast and went for the little square as soon as we opened our hands.<br /><br />The sniff part of the after dinner tests were a little inconclusive. Maggie went for the Newman's completely. But Lucy was a little confused at first. She kept sniffing the Milkbone hand initially -- but we believe there was contamination problem with the test because I had just eaten a Cheez-It. After the old switcheroo, she went for the Newman's instantly.<br /><br />So, the dogs preferred to eat the Newman's, but Lucy initially preferred the faint smell of Cheez-Its contaminant in one sniff test session.<br /><br />From a cookie giver's perspective, Newman's did not have an overwhelming gross smell to it. The bag it comes in has a zip top, so they may keep their scent longer than the average Milkbone turning stale inside a cardboard box.<br /><br />Note: I did think the obviously Photoshopped Paul Newman graphic on the packaging was a little creepy.

All three dogs love this treat.  I give the whole piece to the Lab and then break another in half and give 1 half to the MinPin and the other half to the Chihuahua.  The first two devour this treat in seconds but it takes the Chihuahua half a day to make it through the treat.  I think that's good.  It gives him something to do and it'll clean his teeth too.  The treat is very crumbly if they break it apart.  My dogs always clean up the crumbs afterwards, but probably shouldn't feed this treat to them on the carpet.  All in all - I would highly recommend this product as a good, healthy, tasty treat for dogs that is hypoallergenic and can help break the tartar off their teeth.  It smells very clean and fresh, like a granola bar and the dogs love it!"

We have a yellow lab who absolutely loved them, a few bites and it was gone. She had no problems chomping it up. Our maltese took her time and ate every last crumb she could find. Our shih tzu did the same. Their offspring had no problems as well. Our maltese is a mere 9lbs and I did not need to break them in half. I do like the fact they have the line down the center for easy breaking in two. Our eldest is quite picky, she is 17 and has years of experience with treats. Dispite being picky and not having many teeth left, she did take half of one that was offered and ate it. Mind you- she is a slow eater and can still chew hard treats and food. So 5 out of 5 taste wise.<br /><br />Parent wise, as their owners we want them to eat healthy food with the right ingredients and these fit that criteria. They are not only tasty but healthy. Because they are a dry treat they leave crumbs. Some dogs will clean the crumbs up like mine; however some eat the larger pieces and leave the rest of the mess for you to clean up- so keep that in mind especially if its on a carpet."

For my 50+ lb Golden Retriever puppy that is a good thing because he is a major chewer.  For a very small dog, an elderly dog, or one who might not be much of a chewer at all, they might be a bit much.<br /><br />I cannot attest to the taste, as I didn't go so far as to taste them myself (I'm pretty sure they would not have been pleasing to me anyway), but the puppy seemed to really like them a lot.  It actually took him several minutes to get through one square and he is a mondo chewer, but he was not going to let me take that from him!  He was enjoying it a great deal.  Of course, that said, dogs will pretty much eat anything that fits in their mouths but he seemed to have a particular enjoyment for these so I'm happy with them as an occasional treat for him."

He's young enough to deal with the hard, dry texture, but I wonder if they have as much aroma as more moist treats.  He eats them on the carpet (of course), then has to lick up the crumbs.

However, these things are 1""+ on each side and she can't fit them in her mouth. They come connected to other pieces, so first you have to break these apart from each other. Then if you have a small dog, like an IG for instance, you'll have to break or cut or crumble them up from there. It would be easier if they weren't almost literally rock hard, which makes it really difficult if you're trying to just break them up by hand (which means if you're taking some out with you you'll probably want to prepare them beforehand). But she does want to eat them and when I managed to get a small enough piece for her she ate it up; a slightly larger one she worked on and worked on trying to chew on it.<br /><br />These are USDA organic treats and they must be doing something right, because as I said our IG gets totally excited when she sees the bag being picked up.

There was no doubt in my mind that Harry, Pepper, and Honey would love these treats.  Dixie, on the other hand... well, I wasn't sure.<br /><br />Dixie is right there with everyone else when the treat bag is opened, but when she gets her treat, more often than not she goes back to her spot, lies down with the treat in front of her, and she guards it for a while.  Later we'll find it under the furniture or half buried in the yard.  The really yummy treats (hot dogs, anyone?) are gulped on the spot, but everything else is hoarded for, I guess, the day we forget to feed her.<br /><br />But not these.  Dixie was right there in the lineup, waiting for her treat.  Everyone got one, and there was much loud crunching to be heard.  A couple of minutes later, everyone was back, doing the cookie dance, trying to convince me that I'd somehow forgotten them, and Dixie was right there with them.  The second cookie was crunched as quickly (and as loudly) as the first.<br /><br />This was shortly after dinner, so I know it wasn't starvation that drove her to it.<br /><br />Honey is the smallest, at about 50 pounds, so these are big dogs, and a whole, unbroken treat was the right size for them.  I'd guess that breaking the treat at the halfway mark would make them the right size for a medium sized dog.  Toy breed owners might want to get out the hammer.<br /><br />These are very hard treats, so they're probably good for the teeth.  They left quite a few crumbs when crunched, but the crumbs were gone in seconds.  The package was hard, too... you should be able to tear it at the notch, but mine was still sealed when I tore off the top.  You might want to have scissors handy.<br /><br />Currently the package promises ""Made with organic barley - no wheat - no corn"".

Not at all. Oranges, cherry plums, lettuce, bok choy, and tofu(!) are cherished by her; she holds the bok choy with both paws as if it were a bone. She's not totally easy (she refuses to eat spinach--probably some early puppy experience), but calling her the goat of Goldens would not be a cheap shot.<br /><br />However, it's important that Sadie stay away from typical canine snacks, especially at her age.

In fact, my dog's Vet recently told me, that if he sees an obese dog, he can just glance at the owner, and they will often share the problem.  Not only that, but I've seen photos of dogs and owners, where I swear there was a shared physical resemblance.  What do we try to do, make our dogs into a little mini-me?  With this sudden jarring epiphany, I think we're in trouble here.<br /><br />Although my dog is far from a 'mini-me,' at 126 lbs and 30"" tall, given the opportunity to select a healthy, organic snack, over an inferior product, well...let me just make this analogy.  If I'm really having a craving for a snack, and there is a bag of Cheetos in the cabinet, I'm more likely to grab them, than the 'all natural' carrot sticks and celery in the veggie drawer. Enough said, and I clearly know better.  My Shepherd doesn't. He eats a high quality food, but I have let him dictate his treats, based on his observable level of enjoyment. In essence---we DO spoil our dogs, and ourselves.<br /><br />In test after test, given the opportunity to select the 'Newman's Own' treat, over my dog's favorite bargain brand---okay, Milk Bones, he would go for the MB every single time. But, toward the end of the bag of Newman's Own, I began to notice a change in enthusiasm.  Maybe eating healthy for humans and dogs, alike, is an aquired taste, or simply a change in habits.<br /><br />Will I purchase Newman's Own, after this trial? Absolutely! I'm sold on the all natural ingredients, the absence of chemicals and the product analysis. The only thing I found missing from the product description is the calorie count, with recommendations for appropriate number of treats, daily, which I think is important for managing weight. Although with the few 'natural' ingredients listed (Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Apples, Organic Palm Oil and Organic Molasses, preserved with Mixed Tocopherols---a source of Vi E) I doubt the calorie count could be that high, as these are not large treats.<br /><br />These treats are hard, and dense, which gave my dog a good dental workout, even with his mouth the size of a small alligator. Of course, it was gone in just a minute (but so is everything else), but smaller dogs would likely enjoy chewing on one of these for a while.<br /><br />I say, give them a try. You won't find anything healthier (per the product description), unless you decide to make your own dog biscuits, which many of my friends are now doing. But, doing so, wouldn't be more cost effective, because you would need to purchase all organic, while baking them in small batches due to preservative issues."

Much like those unappealing high-fiber diet bars that humans eat when they're on some sort of regimented weight loss program. Also, I prefer my dog treats to be in cute shapes...bones, hearts, rounds, rolls, etc. These were just regular squares. And since the cookies were so hard, I was afraid the corners would cut the mouths/gums of my smaller dogs.<br /><br />PROS - If you read the label, the ingredients are high quality. They're the stuff I look for when I buy their every day food.<br /><br />Dog tested: My big German Shepard, who usually likes chicken jerky treats (and won't eat anything that has a smoky flavor like Beggin Strips), ate her biscuits. However, she wasn't terribly interested and definitely didn't think it was treat. It looked as if she just ate it because it smelled edible and it was there. She didn't even wolf it down like she normally does with her treats. My Cocker Spaniel, who usually begs me for everything and is highly food motivated, took a sniff and and a lick but ultimately was not interested in these wholesome treats. As for my little Pomeranian, well it was too hard and big of a biscuit for him.<br /><br />Even thought these treats are supposed to be nutritious and healthy, I only gave them 1 star because my dogs and I didn't enjoy them."

The dog seemed to enjoy them, he did not choke, and everything seemed to be dandy.  I am not a dog person, do not have a dog, but I know lots of people have them and love them.

Seriously, I just got a 10-ounce bag today and she got very greedy after getting a taste. This is a healthy, organic treat that we don't have to feel guilty about feeding (in moderation) to our three year old pointer.<br /><br />My wife and I try to provide good nutrition for our dog. Corn, wheat, and soy are basically useless filler when it comes to dogs. They can't digest it, and furthermore many dogs are allergic to wheat. These Newman's Own Ranch Style treats do not contain any of those ingredients. They also do not contain any artificial additives, not for flavoring or coloring.<br /><br />Also important: these treats are NOT a product of China. I would sooner prepare all my dog's food from scratch than feed her any dog food/treats produced in China. These treats are a product of New Zealand.<br /><br />Grains are not an essential part of a dog's diet, but the one grain included in these treats - organic barley - is (from what I understand) generally an acceptable one. It's the first ingredient, followed by lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses. Again, all organic. And that's it - very simple."

They've had no bad reactions whatsoever to them.<br /><br />The treats are 2 1"" x 1"" squares attached together, with a line incised between the squares so they can be broken apart for smaller dogs.  They are fairly thick and substantial enough that it takes a few minutes for our dogs to finish them.  They don't wolf them down in one gulp which is a good thing.

My 10oz bag came with 18 full size treats.<br /><br />I like the rectangular shape of the treat.  Sometimes my large dogs get excited about treats & forget about ""nicely"".  With the rectangular shape, my hands won't fall victim to an enthusiastic chomp.  Since the treats are scored down the middle, I can break them down, so my older, smaller dogs can easily eat the treat.<br /><br />Overall, I think the ingredients are excellent for a dog treat, and it is nice that they are adaptable for different sized dogs."

The treats are sized for medium sized dogs (you can always give bigger dogs two) and the nice feature that I like is they come in a rectangle that has a line division down the middle that can be used to break the treat in half if you have a smaller dog.

The promises on the package look good - made with organic barley, no wheat, no corn - and the analysis on the back tells me that my West Highland White Terrier will receive 9% minimum of crude protein, 4% minimum of crude fat, 4% maximum of crude fiber.  The ingredients are organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic applies, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), and organic molasses.<br /><br />So it sounds good, but how will it be received.  I cannot say that my Westie is a particularly fussy eater (I have yet to meet a terrier who is), but there have been times that he has opted to walk away rather than take a second treat, so I can only assume that after his first bite he was less than interested.  Like any good dog, he can running at the sound of the package rustling, with high hopes that this might be for him.  I pulled out a treat approximately the size of the mousepad on my laptop (or you can look at your keyboard - as wide as your Shift key and as tall as Enter and Shift together).  While my little guy thinks he's a big dog, I know better, so this had to be broken down.  Fortunately, there is a nice perforation down the middle making it easy to break apart for him.  That half would still be a pretty big treat for a smaller dog, but it works nicely for my little guy.<br /><br />I gave him one piece and he took it and waited, hoping I would go ahead and hand him the other so he could take them both away.  After I told him one was all he was going to get, he took his piece out in the yard (he likes to go on the deck to eat his treats).  In just a couple of minutes, he was back and waiting patiently for another.  As soon as I produced the other half, he was up on his back legs and watching that treat intently.  Even now he is watching me since he heard the crinkling as I was getting the information off the bag.  I think my Westie is Newman's Own's newest fan!<br /><br />These are a little pricier than the treats I typically purchase for him, but if you only use these for special treats it should not be too much.  Besides, it makes sense to me to care just as much about what I put into his body as I can about what I put into mine."

But mainly, they won't stink up my car if I take them with me someplace. They are a nice size for bigger dogs, but have scores on them so you can break them up to smaller sizes.

After initially leaving the treat alone she came back to finish it and now she'd eat them all day if I let her.

The ONLY negative I noticed is that these cookies were really hard - not just crunchy, but HARD and several of my older dogs had some difficulty breaking them down and chewing them.

These are rather large biscuits that are made to break in half which makes them a perfect size for a snack or reward.  They have a good crunch which I think is good for dental health.  Anyway, I have a box of Alpo Variety Snacks and a box of Milk Bone Flavor Snacks to which I compared ingredients.  They both have artificial color, Alpo lists animal digest, whatever that is, while Milk Bone won the contest with all of those ingredients that no one can pronounce.  I would list what makes up all three but think it would not be too interesting and you probably have at least one of the listed brands if you give your pet treats.<br />What sets the Newman's Own apart is the simple list of Organic ingredients including lamb, carrots, apples, molasses, barley and tocopherols for Vitamin E.  It is made in New Zealand where they raise a lot of lamb, so this seems just the perfect place. The bottom line is our dogs think Pa and Nell Newman have a great product and would highly recommend it to their four legged friends.  Life could not be better than living with happy dogs.

I was more careful on the other side, and tore it towards the zipper opening.<br />- The treat come in bunches of two, and since they are pretty thick (over 1/4 inch or so) I found it difficult to split them into individual services. Two would be too much for small dogs. However, if you have a larger animal they might be more appropriate.<br /><br />Summary: A good choice for dog treats. Recommended."

With milk bones, she whines and tries to bury them in the sofa cushions and finally after a day or two, maybe, eat them.  All this is said so you can see just how finicky she is.  She really does not like anything hard.  These treats are thick and rectangular with a score down the middle so you can break them in to two squares.  I broke one and my dog carefully took it from my hand and then looked at me as if to say ""now what"".  She set it down, looked at me again and then picked it up again.  She didn't try to bury it like she does with milk bones but tried to eat it.  Several minutes went by as she gnawed away, making no progress.  I took it away from her and the outside was a little softer but the biscuit was still too hard.  She really wanted it back so I let her work on it a little longer.  She still hadn't managed to get any off of it so I took it away and soaked it in warm water for a couple of minutes.  This softened it just enough that she munched it down.<br /><br />The next time I offered her one of these treats, she held it in her mouth for a few minutes and the next thing I hear is crunching!!

The first thing upon opening up the resealable package is that the treats are a little on the large size and seem to be meant to break in half as there is a line down the middle that allows you to snap in two.  These should not be considered training treats because they are much too big to feed to your dog several times a day.  I did smell them before giving them to the dogs and the smell seemed fresh and reminded me of a regular cookie which is what they resemble.<br /><br />Now for taste I left that to the dogs.  I have two dogs a Schipperkie and a Mini Aussie that are given treats twice a day plus training treats.  They only eat the finest products which are fresh from the dog bakery or a gourment dog treat store so it is safe to say the dogs are somewhat pickey.  When I first gave the treats they both took them from me and ran off to enjoy. Now it is important to note that when they get a really special treat they each go to there favorite place to enjoy and keep the other dog from stealing the treat.  In this case the dogs ate their treats next to each other so I am going to assume they did not feel that the treat was all that special.  Next I put the Newman Treat in the bowl with a cookie that smells like a pizza from the dog bakery.  One dog took the Newman cookie first and the other dog took the pizza cookie first which was smaller than the Newman treat.  The dogs digested the food properly after checking as the poop size was normal after a week of using the Newman product as their daily treats.<br /><br />All in all I wish the product was sold in a smaller size but the quality of the treat seemed to be good and the dogs liked the treats but I dont feel they loved them (as I mentioned before they did not go to their special place to eat the treats in piece and quite as they will do on their favorite treats).

Having said that, they loved these treats.  They found it hard to sit still to get one (standard house rules) because they had to wiggle and wag and be all-over excited about them.<br /><br />Each bag contains only 10 ounces of treats, which does make them expensive, but good ingredients never come cheap (if price is your only deciding factor, brace yourself before you go look at those fish skins).

I've had about forty years worth of dogs, and they've all gotten one sort of biscuit or another, and I've tasted the varieties.  With only two exceptions I've not been able to discern any of the advertised flavors.  Neither peanut butter, nor liver, nor any of the assorted others.  The best biscuit I've tasted was given out at a neighborhood coffee spot.  The waitress brought it out to the table I was sharing with my good dog Sam, and asked me if I'd like to give it to him.  It looked an awful lot like the scone I had on my own plate, so I said yes, and waited for her to leave.  Once she was out of sight I tasted it, and if it wasn't the same as my scone it was darn close.  Since I had my own, Sam got his, but I have considered going back for coffee and a doggy treat sans doggie.  The other biscuit whose flavoring I could taste was baked by my wife and it was something like an over-baked crust of bread.  My good dog Shalako ate 'em up - I passed on future offerings.<br /><br />On to Newman's Own.  I'm a sucker for anything Newman's Own - not that I like everything the company puts out, but I appreciate the altruism - so I jumped at the chance to review Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley etc's.  Upon opening the package I was hit with an aroma.  Nothing that got my mouth watering, but very few dog biscuits have an aroma, so that was a good sign.  The biscuits were a good color - standard brown, but they didn't look dyed.  Another good sign.  What also surprised me was how solid they were.  Not at all crumbly, and it took a bit of effort to break it in half, even though each biscuit is scored for breaking.<br /><br />I put the first biscuit behind my back and changed hands a few times, spreading the aroma.  When I held my closed fists out for Sam to choose the one with the biscuit he sniffed both but fixated on the correct one right away.  It was that good aroma.  When I gave it to him I think he was as surprised as I with its hearty texture.  I could see it was a good tooth cleaner, and as Sam never gets animal bones, a good thing to have.  The next test was for him to choose from hands that each held a biscuit, one with Newman's, the other with another brand.  The strong aroma didn't work to Newman's advantage this time, and Sam went for the hand with his old familiar treat.  But as soon as he downed it he was sniffing around for the Newman's Own that I still held out in front of me.<br /><br />I don't know if these tests prove anything.  I skipped the human taste test as the biscuits are so durable I was afraid I'd crack an implant.<br /><br />I'd buy Newman's if I saw them, but not for myself.  I'd get them for Sam.  He's a dog who deserves a good treat."

Fortunately, a good number arrived pre-broken, and those are the ones the JRTs been getting.

The one inch square bricks are joined together in pairs - pairs than can be separated by hand at the indentation in the middle. Trying to make furthur manual divisions is fruitless unless one is a pro wrestler or football player. The treats are also too big, I thought, for our two dogs. Now what?<br /><br />Using the serrated edge of a metal ice cream scoop I was able to break the biscuits into manageable pieces. After some intial sniffing and backing away Gabby and Piper took their first tastes and seemed to like the new treat. On subsequent days they've taken to them more and more eagerly. Just to see what would happen, I gave a whole biscuit to Gabby the Bolognese. She coccooned in her doggy bed and ate the whole treat leaving a few crumbs behind but not as many as expected. The next couple days I gave her whole biscuits again. These biscuits were carried about the house all day and hidden in secret places like on the middle of our bed, on the sofa, and on  the stairs leading to the upper level. She hasn't tried to bite into a whole biscuit after the first and only time.<br /><br />Piper the shih tzu just can't handle these biscuits because of their size and hardness. As long as she seems to enjoy eating them, I don't mind using the ice cream scoop to break the Newman treats for her.<br /><br />I like the recipe ingredients used to make the lamb and barley treats and the absence of fillers and artificial chemicals used in many supermarket treats. The organic aura is also a plus.<br /><br />Based on our experience I think these wholesome treats are best for larger dogs who have the teeth and jaw power to tackle and enjoy such hard biscuits.

My dogs love these biscuits and eagerly offered a ""sit"" before I had a chance to fully open the package.  Lamb and rice, yum!<br /><br />My wife was curious and tasted a bit.  She said it tasted good like Zwieback crackers. (I took her word for it but didn't try it myself).  My two dogs eagerly chomped them up.  The only negative to these tasty treats in my opinion is their size.  I'd prefer a treat about the size of a pencil eraserhead for my small dogs as I like to give treats frequently for training.  The large size are a mega size treat.  I won't give them anything less than five stars. These biscuits are yummy!"

They love this, and they especially love the dog moms who bring treats.<br /><br />My dog is a little weird.  She doesn't really like treats -- or rather, she doesn't like a lot of treats.<br /><br />So I thought between my dog and the 5 or 6 others that join the walk, I could give a good review of this product.<br /><br />The consensus:  Every dog liked them!  So that's the main thing that you're looking for when you spend your money on dog treats.  If natural ingredients are important to you, then you can depend on Newman's Own.<br /><br />The one thing that makes me hesitate in giving them 5 stars is that they are big and crumbly.  Crunchy dog treats are good for their teeth I think, but these are 2 x 1 inches big, with a scored line to break them into 2 1 x 1 inch treats.  I found that the scored area was easy to separate, but even so, they are kind of big.<br /><br />So when my dog (a 40 lb mixed breed) ate them, they made a big mess!<br /><br />The other dogs on the walk are the same size or bigger, except for one tiny Shih Tzu.  She wasn't intimidate and tackled the treat with gusto as well.<br /><br />There are about 10 to 15 bars per bag (scored in two, so 20 to 30 treats).  I didn't think to count them when they first arrived, but that's my best guess."

If you want to give your dog healthy organic treats that they'll like, these treats are it.<br /><br />These treats are about 2 inches by 1 inch, scored in the middle so that you can break them in half (even scored, it can be difficult to break them in half). These treats are very hard - so if you have a dog with dental problems (like a senior dog), they will have problems eating these treats. If you have a dog that leaves crumbs and doesn't vacuum the floor for every morsel, you'll find plenty of crumbs after your dog eats these treats.<br /><br />Taste-wise, my dogs loved these treats. I have 2 large dogs (Labs) who, granted, love all treats. I decided to try a taste test - since my dogs will eat their favorite treat first, I was curious to see how these treats fared with some of their other treats. I gave my dogs these treats, a lite doggie treat, and a bacon/cheddar treat (both of these treats are made by Old Mother Hubbard). Of the three times I tried this test, one Lab consistently preferred the Old Mother Hubbard (OMH) bacon/cheddar treat (and would eat this treat a quick second), the other Lab preferred the Newman's Own treats. Considering that the Lab who ate the OMH treats first, tried to eat these at almost the same time, I'll say he liked these treats a lot too.<br /><br />For the amount of treats and with Amazon's current price, I think this is great deal for a healthy doggie treat."

I know, petty reason for not getting the biscuits, but when the pet store is an additional ten miles away from your grocer you begin to wish that the local shop had better options.<br /><br />Luckily they have the Newman's Own Organics at our grocer.<br /><br />Our dogs loved these biscuits.  Not only did my wife and I have the peace of mind giving our girls these treats due to the wonderful ingredient list but it turns out that the dogs adore these treats.

(and she's not an excitable animal)  She stood on her hind legs and pranced about.  I was completely amused.  I told her to sit.  (she's also very stubborn)  She sat, her little paws shaking, she wanted that treat so bad.  I said take it like a lady.  And ever so gently she took the biscuit.  And then she ate like a hog.<br /><br />The biscuits are bigger than the treats we normally give her.  They smell fresh.  There doesn't appear to be any artificial color in it, at least it doesn't stain her beard.  I really feel good about giving Pepper these treats, and she seems pleased as punch to get them.  I've honestly never seen her that excited about a treat.  We'll have to get them once and awhile, she actually listens when these are waiting in the wings.<br /><br />*UPDATE* We just bought more of these for Ms. Pepper and I'm not kidding you, when she saw the bag she did a little dance about sat at my feet and just waited.

How would ""I"" rate the item?  Do ""I"" like it?  Uh, sure, I feel really emotional about this item and I absolutely love it, can't you just picture me sitting here chewing on one of these treat biscuits?<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn't joke too much here since there's been stories of some people eating dog food for years, but really, I'm the human in the animal+human equation here and my opinion really isn't the one that matters for this product.  What matters is what the doggie thinks, or how she seems to react to being given one of these treats.  It's here that things remain tough though as the family dog behaves like many dogs do -- if it's at all edible, and heck, for a lot of things that aren't (like her stuffed toys that all die quick deaths), she'll have it gone so quickly you question whether she ever even tasted whatever it was you gave her.<br /><br />With that said, these dry biscuits do tend to slow her down a little, at least compared to some of the other treats we might give her.  (For example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OUOYH6"">Cardinal Laboratories Pet Botanics Training Rewards Treats, Beef 20 Ounces</a>).  Being dry, she's got to slow down a bit and crunch up these treats.  In our case, with a smaller dog (Pomeranian), she really has to crunch things up, even if we break these biscuits apart (they come as breakable bars with two smaller portions in each bar).  A larger dog wouldn't have that much work to do, or at least I doubt they would.  I'll find out a bit later as I intend to take a few of these treats over to my lady friend's house where her much bigger family dog can give them a try.<br /><br />Realistically, the Newman's Own brand is one that I enjoy supporting.  They have a good reputation for me and their products are always good.  These dog treats seem to be yet another good example of that."

They are shaped as two pieces that can easily be broken in half.  Each 1/2 piece is a bit large for training, I would prefer smaller bits, but the 1/2 piece makes a nice mouthful for a medium sized dog (45 lb).  The biscuits are a rather drab brown, a simple rectangular shape, very utilitarian, favoring function over form.<br /><br />Now the real test.  I gave one to my dog.  She was hesitant at first, but gave in and attacked the treat with gusto.  Her normal behavior for getting a treat is to sit.  Once she finished the first treat, she got into the sit position, and stared intently at me and the bag, eager to earn another.  I gave her a second, and it was gone in moments.  I then placed her regular treat (a Milkbone) 2 feet apart from one of these treat, made the dog wait for 15 seconds.  When I let her go, she went first for the Newman treat.  Once gone, she went just a quickly to the Milkbone.  Hardly a scientific test, but interesting all the same.<br /><br />As for the packaging, the item says it's a 6-pack of treats, but I received only a single bag of treats.  For the price, this is in no way worth it for a single bag.  For 6 bags, however, this would be competitive with ""name brand"" snacks, and the ingredients list would cause me to choose this first."

However, a few days later, after receiving a daily helping, we notice she was leaving the snacks unfinished.

My dog is happy for any attention and will eat just about anything. The worse it smells to me, the better the dog likes it. My dog's absolute favorite treat is a horrible herring-flavored dog biscuit from the specialty pet store--to me it smells like rotten fish but just opening the package will cause the dog to run into the room.<br /><br />My poor pooch suffers from food allergies so I have to be careful what he eats. This dog biscuit is everything I look for: no corn, no chemicals, no mysterious ""by-products"". To date, my dog has had no reaction to these biscuits. This is a big deal because the wrong food can give him running sores under his long coat and make him itchy and miserable. NEWMAN'S LAMB AND BARLEY biscuit has an attractive (to me) smell that is reminiscent of  molasses, which is one of the ingredients. Each biscuit has a groove down the middle making it easy to break, so one has a choice to feed the whole biscuit (suitable for a big dog) or only half (for a smaller dog).<br /><br />The dog doesn't go wild for these things, but he does like them. Based on his body language when these are offered, they rate at least a seven. I love these things and would rate them as five stars because they are healthy and safe for my special needs pet. The four star rating comes from my dog. We agree on that much!"

He runs with it, and he often tempts you to grab the treat from right in front of him when he finally stops.  He runs in circles and acts really funny.  To make this time even more special for him, I often try different treats to make sure it truly is a ""treat"" for him.  I was interested to try these Newman's treats because of the brand recognition.  To determine if he liked them, I fed him one, and we played his little game.  The next day, I laid three different treats out to see which one he would grab.  He didn't grab the new one.  I did that again for a few days.  He consistently grabbed the Newman treat second.  So, based on this in-depth scientific research, I would say he liked the treat as well as we like green beans.  We like green beans, but they're not the same as a piece of cheesecake and not gross like a brussel sprout."

My dog is a Cockapoo and although he is generally not a picky eater, he likes some treats more than others.  (So far the Science Diet treats and Milkbones have not been winners.)<br /><br />My first impression was that I really liked the ingredients list.  Unlike a lot of dog treats, I actually understood and recognized all the ingredients and the fact that the ingredients were all organic were a plus.  Of course, I knew none of this would make a difference if my dog didn't like them.<br /><br />So what was the result?  Most of the time he really likes these treats, though he still prefers more of the jerky-style and chewy treats.  (I know this because there have been a few occasions when he has turned these treats down for whatever reason but will still gladly accept one of the others.)  Most of the time though he seems very happy to have one of these.<br /><br />Worth noting, these treats seem a little large for my 20-lb sized dog.  They can easily be broken in half, but breaking them in half again from there can be tricky.  Unlike some other large-sized treats he doesn't have a difficult time eating these, but boy are they crumbly.  Because he has to take several bites to eat one crumbs usually go everywhere.  He's a thorough eater so generally I haven't had a problem with a mess being left behind BUT I don't know that I would want him eating these treats on carpet or another surface where crumbs could get trapped.<br /><br />Overall, they are a good treat.  I appreciate the ingredient list and the fact my dog likes them, but wish they were a little smaller so he could eat them without them crumbling everywhere."

He will only eat the treats if they are mixed with canned dog food.

I give it three stars because, despite my finicky dog's lack of a desire to snatch them from my hand, the treats smell good and this appears to be a trustworthy and relatively healthy offering."

Our pooches were just as happy to eat Newman's Own Lamb and Barley Dog Treats as they do their regular organic treats. Taste wise, they seem to rate 5 stars.<br /><br />Take note that these treats are hard. If your pooch is a gulper, you might need to break it into pieces. Our dogs are all chewers and took their time right down to licking the floor to get the crumbs.<br /><br />Price wise, these treats cost slightly more than the organic brands I usually buy. It appears Amazon will eventually provide these through the ""Subscribe and Save"" program. If / when that happens, the 15% discount will bring these down in price. Until then, I'm knocking off one star for price.<br /><br />If you question whether, in general, it's worth paying a premium price for organic foods and treats, read on.<br /><br />Treat prices and ingredient quality vary wildly. Higher quality almost always equals higher price. Products certified ""organic"" usually add yet another premium.<br /><br />Whether or not you buy organic pretty much depends on whether or not you've given thought to what your dog is eating. In our case, we admitedly gave it little thought. At the super market we always bought name brand foods and treats and figured that doing so made us good gaurdians.<br /><br />Oliver, our 8 year old dachsund, suffered loose stools and had trouble keeping down food for years. After a really bad case of him having the runs, it was recommended that we try changing his diet to certified organic products containing no wheat or corn.<br /><br />We learned that grains used in most super market dog food and treats are often a mixture of wheat and corn said to cause allergies that can cause stomach problems.<br /><br />Additionally, products not certified organic are allowed to be inconsistent. Between batches, the amount of meat by-products can vary wildly.  By-products include lungs, spleen, kidneys, brain, liver, blood, bone, and stomach and intestines.<br /><br />Also, non-organic pet food can be leagally made from meat sources rejected for human consumption. Shockingly, even brand name pet food manufacturors are often a legal dumping ground for dead, dying, disabled and deseased animals.<br /><br />Making the change to all organic food and treats made a difference with Olliver in just a few days. It's been years now since I've had to clean up one of his messes.<br /><br />Olliver's canine housemates had no qualms eating the lower grade food. While they don't seem to care we made the choice to feed them better, we sure feel better knowing what it is they're really eating."

I was impressed the certified organic ingredients, the re-sealable bag, and I like that they are large bones, but are scored so they can be broken in half. Left whole, the treats are good for large dogs, but when broken in half would be good for medium-sized dogs. They seem a bit too hard for small dogs.<br /><br />Our dogs usually like lamb flavored food, so this seemed like a good choice. We have three dogs and each had their own reaction to the treat. Our smallest dog, who usually likes anything, would barely sniff the treat and didn't even try to eat it. The middle-sized dog who is more picky wouldn't eat it at first. After playing with it for a few minutes, he finally did eat it. I'm assuming the smell wasn't appealing to him since it doesn't smell like a typical dog treat. Our dogs are used to a variety of store-bought and homemade dog treats. However, these organic treats smelled like hay to me (I'm assuming that's the barley), and therefore weren't very well received by two of my dogs.<br /><br />Our Golden Retriever likes most any treats and she ate this one without hesitation. While the treats might be great for some, since only one of our dogs will eat the treats regularly, I don't think they would be worth the extra cost for our household."

My dogs certainly liked the flavor, but they aren't a fussy crew -- still, I feel good about this biscuits. The reason I'm holding back a star is because two out of three of my dogs -- my greyhound and my sheltie -- are seniors and this is a harder treat than is really comfortable for them and the treats are hard to break into pieces. (Soaking in water for a couple minutes seems to help.) Some dogs genetically have really made tartar prone teeth and that's these two and there have been extractions over the years. My dachshund also has to work to crunch through it due to the size -- remember, couldn't break it -- and the hardness, but she managed.<br /><br />If you have a medium and up dog with good teeth, them this is quite highly recommended. If you're constantly looking for a softer treat, they're less ideal and might at least need a little soak."

I don't think you can ask for much more than that from a dog treat.  They are pretty hard and a pretty good size, so the dog seems to have a little trouble getting it broken down (she's a relatively small beagle).  Really small dogs might need these broken up a bit.  I don't think it's a problem that they take a while for the dog to consume, since that means she eats it a bit slower and it's longer before she comes back to me begging for some more."

I don't feed her table scraps or people food aside from an occasional raw or frozen carrot, and I don't switch her regular food very often, because her system is fairly sensitive to changes in her diet.  She handled the Newman biscuits with no problems at all.<br /><br />I would probably feed her these treats on a regular basis if price were no object; however, these are a premium product and are priced accordingly.

He preferred to play with these rather than eat them. Usually he will eat a treat in about a minute but this treat stayed in his cage with him picking it up and dropping it for hours. He has very powerful jaws and he usually tears up most of his toys in a day or two, yet he did not wont to eat these very much. Whatever they put in this is not very appealing to dogs apparently.<br /><br />Your dogs may like this better (hopefully). Again this is a VERY hard threat so make sure your dogs don' t mind having to gnaw at it for awhile. Also, if your dog acts like it doesn't like it then it probably never will, so give the pooch a different treat."

The product arrived timely and well packaged. I received one 10oz. re-sealable pouch.  Newman's states that the product is organic, which Newman's say means the production systems seek to provide food and fiber products of the highest quality. The treats are rectangular dog biscuits, that are about 1 inch by 2 inches.  Each biscuit is scored in the middle so it is easy to break the biscuit into two pieces.<br /><br />The package listed the ingredients as: Organic barley, Organic lamb, Organic carrots, Organic apples, Organic palm oil, and Organic molasses.<br /><br />Newman's claims that the dog biscuits do not contain poultry by-products, chemical fertilizers, antibiotics, chemical additives or artificial preservatives, no wheat or corn, and no artificial flavors. The biscuits had a pleasant smell and looked like quality dog biscuits.  But of course, the real test was, would the dogs like them. Well, the dogs devoured each biscuit I gave them and I think they would have easily eaten the entire bag at one time if I let them!<br /><br />This seems like a good quality product, which my dogs greatly enjoyed so I give Newman's New Zealand Lamb and Barley organic dog treats a 5 star rating."

Maybe its spending the first year of his life in a pound, but even now - he LOVES to eat.  So when the opportunity to try a new snack came along, he informed me that it was my only choice.<br /><br />I do like that these are organic... not that my dog cares. But I still would prefer if the first ingredient was a meat or meat based product.  My dog has canine teeth made for gripping, tearing, and scissoring which means that the rest of his body is set up for the consumption of MEAT.  Not corn, potatoes, barley etc.  Now granted the ingredients in here are far better than a milkbone, but you pay for them as well.<br /><br />These come in a nice little rectangle shape that is scored down the middle (like a short fat graham cracker) I didn't bother breaking it at the score because he would know and not leave me alone until the other half appeared.  Needless to say - they are VERY hard, but apparently quite tasty.  I don't know that a little dog, or a baby puppy could eat them but since Indy is a 60lbs Australian Shepherd/Springer Spaniel mix (with a smattering of other doggies in there too) he had no trouble eating them.

The only problem we had was with the size of the treats and the hardness of them for dogs that are as old as our two pets.  We did have to break them up into little pieces but then they quickly devoured them, seemingly having no trouble chewing up the pieces.  We did a test by placing their old brand of treats on a plate along with the Lamb and Barley treats; they finished the latter first and were looking for more so I surmised they felt the extra chewing was worth it.

The ingredients list is ""Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Organic Apples, Organic Palm Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols, a Source of Vitamin E), Organic Molasses"".  The ""Guaranteed Analysis"" is Crude Protein:  9.0% min, Crude Fat:  4.0% min, Crude Fiber:  4.0% max, Moisture:  11% max"".  FYI, despite being ""certified organic"", there is a ""Not Intended for Human Consumption"" disclaimer under the ingredients list.  Hence, I can personally testify to their delectability (or lack thereof)...  ;o)<br /><br />However, my ""test panel"" certainly can - if they could talk, that is.  Testing these treats were our four rescued shelter dogs:  Jolene, a female Pit Bull & Boxer mix, Niki, a female Boxer mix, Cosmo, a male Boxer mix, & Mollie, a female Black Lab Mix.  In the interest of full disclosure, the first three dogs listed are all eager & voracious eaters - rarely, if ever, do they turn up their noses at a treat.  Mollie, on the other hand, is far pickier, being a tentative eater.<br /><br />Once placed in a ""sit"", all four test subjects eagerly anticipated their treat.  For the test, I gave each of them a single 1"" x 1.25"" treat, having broken them apart in another room.  I gave each subject a treat, one at a time.  Jolene, Niki & Cosmo took their treat without hesitation (Cosmo rudely almost taking half of my fingers with his), while Mollie had to give it a short ""sniff"" (as is her custom) prior to gingerly taking it from my hand.  However, once in their possession, all four dogs eagerly devoured their treat, crunching it up in short order, Mollie included.  None of the them had any trouble crunching into the treats, from Jolene who is only 40 pounds, to Cosmo who is 55 pounds.  Once finished, they all looked back up with hopeful anticipation in case I had another one to offer them.<br /><br />So, based on these tests, I'd say these treats were a resounding success.  If I had to take anything away from their score, it would be to dock them ½ star because they are so hard to break apart.  Of course, if you have relatively big dogs, you could always just give them two attached treats at a time & forego this issue altogether.  Therefore, I still awarded them 5 stars..."

So, I'm not sure how reliable a source I am, because our 15-pound mutt is a little closer to the former category: if it's not bigger than her head, then she'll try to eat it. So, yes, she loves the few of these we've given her so far. They are hard (Milk Bone kind of hard), smallish dry squares that take some effort to break in to small-dog bite-sized pieces, so they test our dog's jaws a little, but her tastebuds don't seem to complain either. Frankly, I like having a treat a dog can't consume in 2 seconds, it's good when she has to work at it a little, both to keep her occupied and to give their teeth and jaws a little workout. Having said that, smaller dogs, weaker-jawed dogs (puppies or the elderly) might not be willing or able to make the effort unless you mash the treat with a hammer or soak it in water or broth for a minute... and why waste your time, just buy a different treat, right?<br /><br />As usual, there's some cute fanciful text on the packaging, and like all Newman's Own products, the net profits go to charity. What's not to like?"

One of my dogs is a little fussy and sometimes turns her nose up at other treats but had no problem inhaling these and asking for more.  Do the math and decide if organic dog treats are worth the extra cash, but if giving you dogs the healthiest treats is a priority I can't see you going wrong with these.

However, before I had opened the bag for the first time I had already used the word treat in front of our Papillon and Pomeranian and, as any dog owner knows, there is no turning back after the T word. I was honestly afraid that my dogs might chip a tooth on these treats, and so I hesitantly offered one up under close observation. Amazingly, after being dropped and picked up a couple of times, both dogs dedicated a few minutes to the treats and refused to give up.<br /><br />While I would not imagine that these would be enjoyable, or edible, for my dogs, they absolutely love them. I suppose if they were human treats my opinion would weigh a little more on my rating, but they are for dogs and my dogs love them."

There's actually an aroma to them -- not like a delicious gourmet aroma, but still, they smell like actual baked food instead of smelling like pressed carboard / sawdust, which is sorta what I think when I smell cheapo dog treats.<br /><br />My small dog (Cavalier King Charles) loves these treats, but the problem is, they're almost too hard for him to eat. He has the small teeth and 'soft mouth' characteristic of his breed and has trouble crunching these up. It's actually a good thing, because it forces him to 'savor' the treats (AKA they last longer), but it's something to consider if your dog is old/missing teeth.<br /><br />Other than that, these treats are great. I don't always buy Newman's Own products, but know when I do that I am purchasing quality products from an ethical company."
14273,B0045XE32E,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,Stephen M. Lerch,0,0,5,1298937600,Baird approved!,"Baird is my 1 year and few months old Shetland Sheepdog. His review of this product would involve a ton of tail wagging, enthusiastic sits, downs and any other trick he knows while he waits for me to hand him the treat!<br /><br />These treats seem to be really good. Baird loved them. They don't smell like dog treats. If you really sniff them yourself you can smell the hints of apple in them. Not having that nasty unnatural dog treat smell clinging to my hands for hours afterwards is a huge bonus as well.<br /><br />If you don't like to give your dog unnatural treats, this is definitely a good choice as every ingredient is certified organic. There is also NO CORN or other filler grains, which is also a bonus, especially if you ensure your dog isn't getting these grains in their regular meals. There's no point in keeping corn and similar grains out of their food if you're just going to hand off a treat that has those fillers.<br /><br />One down side is that, as other reviewers have stated, these treats are on the larger side. I'd say they are 1.5 x 1.5 inches in length and width once you break one in half. For a smaller dog, this might pose choking risks if they don't like to chew. I was worried about how Baird would handle them, but he's responsible in how he eats and chews everything really well. He's also a bit larger than a normal Sheltie. I plan on taking one over to my parents' house and giving it to their Sheltie Kiowa, as he is more the standard breed size for a Sheltie.<br /><br />I'd say, compared to say, Milk Bones, these treats are pretty pricey. However, with Milk Bones you get what you pay for; cheap treats. If you're OK giving your dog Milk Bones (I actually do as he enjoys them and I use them sparingly), you probably won't want to spend the money for these. If you try to ensure your dog has a healthy diet and want treats to match, these will definitely do the trick.<br /><br />Disclaimer - I received this, as it seems did many others, via Amazon Vine, which means I got the treats for free. This fact does not color my review as I treat every item from Vine as though I've paid for it. Plus I can't fake Baird's overly enthusiastic reaction. Though he acts the same way for Milk Bones as well, so who knows?"

Obviously the big draw here is the quality ingredients and assurance of the brand. I probably am more willing to spend on quality brand food for my dog than I am for me. I try to avoid Chinese food products since they have regulatory issues. No need to rehash the whole pet food scandal. That said it's easy to but junk American pet food too so I try to shop carefully. This seems to be a quality dog snack that the dog enjoys...

But the next day, as he  saw me go for the bag a second time - he went ballistic.  When I gave him the treat, he retreated into the den with it as if it were a bone.

14280,B0057QJH6A,A2RPO2VHR1GRO,Jesse Dorland,1,1,3,1333756800,Not a direct substitute for China-made treats.,"I have been looking for alternatives to made-in-China jerky. Because of - I presume - the amount of meat required to make real jerky, this has been a difficult endeavor. Even product lines like Milo's Kitchen source jerky from China while making the rest of their products - the ones they can process with fillers - in the US. True Chews markets US-made jerky treats but the meat is processed with other ingredients into a jerky-shaped chew that doesn't much resemble actual jerky.<br /><br />Likewise, when I received these treats they were not what I expected. ""Jerky,"" to my mind, means plain, dried meat. I thought the other mentioned ingredients would be added as a coating for flavor, but I expected a largely unprocessed product. In fact it is a cubed, compressed product containing significant amounts of grains and other ingredients as filler. My dog liked them but for the price there are other treats he likes better.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations of a treat labeled ""jerky"" are out of line, but I know a lot of people besides me are looking for a US-made jerky treat, and in my opinion this isn't it. On to Blue Buffalo Wilderness jerky. It is several times more expensive but so far the only ""real"" US-made jerky I have found."

And so, I gave these crackers a try, after coming across them in my grocery store. I like the original and cheddar flavours the best (the cheddar flavour is very delicate).<br /><br />1) I have not experienced the breakage problem some mention. Yes, there is a broken cracker here and there, but nothing out of norm. Quite frankly, I think they pack them as they do, in two pouches, two servings each, in order to pump up the volume, so to speak. Each of these boxes contains only four servings (32 crackers). That's not much for the price. This is the only reason for the four, rather then five star rating.<br />2) They are filling and tasty. I am addicted to these crackers with red pepper humus. Yum! They scoop well once you get a hang of it (they are flaky and will break more often then regular crackers would in the same situation).<br />3) The box is made of 100% recycled material, for those to whom this matters.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />PS: There is a warning on the label that says they may contain traces of soy, milk, and sesame, in case anyone is alergic.

A lot of money for crackers! But I thought they were a lot like Ritz crackers and liked them. I tried getting them from Amazon because it seemed like a better price. After I ordered them, I read the reviews that said a lot of the crackers were broken and was a little nervous. Fortunately, that turned out to not be a problem for me.

These, however, are delicious. They do remind me of Ritz crackers (at least what I remember from eating them 2 years ago) except not quite as oily.<br /><br />Good:<br />- They taste good and have a really nice texture.<br />- I don't think they are exceptionally bland - they have a slight buttery flavor and seem like generic crackers to me. Definitely more flavor that water crackers<br />- I don't taste the funny aftertaste that one of the reviewers mentions. Perhaps some people are more sensitive to that taste than I am.<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Cost<br />- Broken crackers: I agree with other reviewers that the packages often contain a lot of broken ones. This is not just when they are purchased online; it is also true of boxes that I've purchased at a store like Whole Foods. I guess these crackers are just fragile and need special packaging.<br /><br />That combination of downsides makes it a tough choice for me about whether to buy these crackers. Do I really want to pay a lot (3-4x as much as ""glutinized"" crackers) for a box of broken crackers? I haven't decided. For now, they are a splurge that I indulge in occasionally."

They ate them without hesitation since they had enjoyed them in the past.  As soon as it hit their taste buds, they said, ""YUK!""<br /><br />When checking out the ingredients, to find out what had happened to these crackers, I found the sunflower addition.

I looked at the ingredients. Corn starch was the first ingredient.<br /><br />I tend not to like gluten free products made mostly from corn starch. They are light, sure, but kind of flavorless and powdery if you chew for any length of time.<br /><br />Brown rice flour or millet gives such a great depth of flavor, and it's an actual whole grain, not just a grain after all the protein and nutrients are taken out. Even white rice flour would be better.<br /><br />Corn starch, however is cheaper so I think that's why it gets used a lot.<br /><br />If you liked white flour, starchy foods before you went gluten free you might like these. If you prefer whole grains or even actual flour (not just the starch) I would try something else. I like Christie's multigrain crackers or brown rice thins."

I never really missed crackers, but after I tasted these at my natural health food store during a tasting they were having - WOW!!!  They are AMAZING and I was hooked.  I also love their vegetable flavor.  I have never tried the cheddar as I cannot have dairy, but I'm sure they are good too.<br /><br />The only problems I have with the crackers are the high saturated fat content and the price.  Of course, with any gluten free item, they are a bit pricey, but that's to be expected, unfortunately.  But they really don't give you a lot in the box for the price.<br /><br />I saw the 'saltine' or 'table' cracker version of Glutino's the other day at my health food store and I was going to get them because I've been wanting 'saltine' type crackers for my soup, but the saturated fat content was really high!!!  Three grams of saturated fat for just THREE crackers.  Ridiculous!!!  Of course, some people don't care about the nutritional/health facts pertaining to the food they eat, but I do... and I would NOT get these because of that.  But the other crackers are really GOOD and the saturated fat content isn't too high.  Still not the greatest, but because they are so delicious, I've made an exception for them."

These crackers reach that standard.  I have served these crackers several times to a gluten-eating crowd and there has always been at least one guest who unsuspectingly eats them, then at some point remembers that I am gluten intolerant, and comes over to me and asks, ""These are gluten free?  Really?""<br />This is so predictable and it tickles me every time.  The only giveaway that they are gluten free is that the word ""Glutino"" is pressed on each and every cracker.  I would prefer maybe an elegant cursive ""g"" on the cracker because I don't think ""Glutino"" sounds particularly appetizing but that is just my humble opinion.<br /><br />I would compare these crackers to the no-salt saltine crackers I used to eat years ago.  They are not quite as crunchy, but they still have crunch.  They are plain but that's why I buy them.  I serve them with different cheeses, hummus, tapenades and smoked trout dip.  I generally don't want anything but a plain cracker for these purposes.<br /><br />I have also crushed these up and used them successfully in place of dry bread crumbs or panko crumbs.<br /><br />The only down side to this product is that there can be more than a few broken crackers in each box.  I would buy an extra box if you are using these for a party and food presentation is an issue.<br /><br />So many of the good gluten free items are quite expensive and these crackers are no exception.  I have learned to eat less and appreciate everything more."

It's not at all salty. Texture...well, it breaks a little too easily, and when you chew it, it feels more powdery in your mouth than what you'd probably think of for a cracker, but it's not bad.  Of the Glutino crackers, we like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CWSK98"">Glutino Gluten Free Multigrain Crackers, 4.4 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> best, because the fennel in the multigrain gives it a little more texture and taste.<br /><br />This is the only brand of GF cracker that my gluten-eating family will eat, other than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00250HYA2"">Sesmark Ancient Grains Chips With Parmesan Herb, 3.5 Ounce Bags (pack of 12)[Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ET93N2"">Sesmark Savory Thins, Original, 3.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)[Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] -- but Sesmark isn't marketed as GF, just as ""no gluten ingredients.""

Perhaps less creamers would burst during transit if the display box shown was wrapped inside a cardboard box.  The box arrived completely undamaged on the outside. None appeared to have frozen during transit, it appears that the creamer singles pop during high altitude transit or perhaps when the box is thrown by the shipper or pressure is placed on the box.

It was an overwhelming salt taste and this flavor is just not for me. I could not eat more than one. This brand's Teriyaki flavor is better. The ""jerky"" is a bit soft, thin and oily. It has a strange texture that breaks into pieces that are more mushy than chewy. It is not as satisfying as the other ""mock meat"" products I've tried,  (2 examples are listed below). I suggest finding a way to taste one piece of this before committing to buy an entire case.<br /><br />For comparison, I would recommend ""Stonewall's Jerquee"" (soy, vegetarian, available on Amazon). Stonewalls has a better, chewer,""meatier"" texture, soft enough to bite into, but drier and firm enough to chew for a short while. It comes in 7 flavors, none of which were unpleasant, like this Primal Strips flavor.<br /><br />Another tasty soy/meatless similar product is ""Manna Soy Gourmet Meatless"" (4 flavors, on Amazon). This comes in big, 4 pound, bags and 4 flavors. It starts out softer than jerky, but can be microwaved into dryer, chewy strips that are very satisfying.

When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!"

I've always called that ""a good strong cup of coffee"".<br />This coffee meets my criteria for that.  It is not bitter and doesn't leave a bad coffee taste in your mouth.<br /><br />I'm a tightwad so the $.55/Kcup appealed to me also.  Sometimes I add a teaspoon of my favorite instant and rotate the Kcup 180 deg. and run it through again.  This gives me a second good cup of coffee at reduced prices.:)<br /><br />I will buy more of the Big Easy Bold."

Body is deep, good aroma with some bitterness that you would expect from a French Roast blend.

Couldn't be happier, it is as described - bold, delicious, loved it.<br /><br />BUT I bought this several times and each time I had problems with my Keurig and the packaging.  The K cups would not empty, would overflow, and would make only 1/2 the amount recommended.  Keurig would say ""prime"" repeatedly after using these cups, and I would have to go through the extensive method of re-priming my Keurig.  I bought this twice, and (yes, I'm slow), with the second batch realized the problem was the packaging of the K cups.  For whatever reason this kept happening.<br /><br />Since I cannot return this item I am stuck with 30 of these that I won't use.<br /><br />I also won't order anything with the blue cups again, especially not this brand.<br /><br />Just to clarify - I am not a serially negative poster, and I have had my Keurig for over 6 months.  I've used multiple other brands without a problem.<br /><br />For now I'm sticking with Paul Newman's extra bold.  Great flavor and no problems with the K cups."

We all consistently agreed across the two times.  So I feel pretty confident in our assessment.  Perhaps others will like this if they put more sugar or cream in it to knock a bit of the bitterness off.  Since I use no cream and only a little sweetener, this is just a bit too strong for us."

14695,B000DZKKK2,A3BSPXD2A2UQ2T,Simply Me,0,0,5,1350345600,Suprisingly GOOD,"I initially purchased a package of this brownie mix from Walmart; it was on clearance. For years, I had no idea why I was always sick. One of the outstanding food problems was chocolate. Consequently, I did not eat it. I was not sad, but every now and again I would want to have a bite of it. It couldn't be too chocolately; it had to be more on the lines of a milk chocolate flavor. Anyway, I made these brownies tonight. Since I like cake-like brownies (not such a concentrated chocolate flavor), I made some changes. I did not use the recipe on the package. In place of the listed 1/2 cup of water, I used 1/2 cup of milk. I also added 1/4 cup of water. I like cooked pecans, so I added slightly chopped pecans in the batter and some whole pecans on top. The result was really good brownies. I like the melted chunks of chocolate in brownies. My brownies were no where close to gritty. This may be due to the fact that I used milk (lactose-free) in place of the main water ingredient. Will buy again and use for events. It won't even be necessary to tell others it is gluten free until AFTER they've said how good they are. (smile)"

My 8 y/o daughter has recently been put on a gluten free diet by her doctor for gluten intolerance (testing for Celiac also) and she was upset that she couldn't have ""anything worth eating"" anymore. I made her these brownies, and she said they were better than my recipe (which was a wheat based brownie)! Along with food intolerances she has high-functioning autism so she is very picky about textures, gritty food bothers her. I noticed a tiny texture difference from the wheat brownies but she gobbled them up anyway, they were THAT good. I made the ""original"" style, and it came out moist, soft, and just gooey enough but not undercooked. I like them better than wheat brownies, because you can cut these while they're still somewhat hot and they don't crumble! Getting them out of the pan hot is a trick but I only broke one brownie doing it. Even my husband, who can have all the gluten he likes, loved them."

14764,B0047ORGWK,A3TPP7AD8TO6A,"Katie Lin ""bumpky""",6,7,4,1305417600,Baby hated solids until I tried NuturMe!,"We started our son on solids when he was six months. The first ""food"" we introduced was rice cereal as recommended by our pediatrician. We tried every day for 2 weeks to feed my son rice cereal and then oatmeal cereal but he hated both! He'd refuse the food by turning away and keeping his mouth tightly shut. I was at my wits end and gave him a break because I knew I had to be patient. I was never a huge fan of the idea of feeding my son rice cereal so I went searching for something that was convenient and came in small portions. I didn't want to feed my son the traditional baby food from a jar due to the risk of BPA found in the jar lids. Luckily, I found NurturMe! My son loved it from the start.  We started with the peas and then worked our way through the apple, squash, and sweet potato.<br /><br />Here is what I love about NuturMe Baby Food:<br /><br />CONVENIENCE. The food comes in BPA-FREE paper pouches that are easy to travel with. They contain the same amount of food as a 2.5oz jar of baby food. When we first started my son on solids he ate 1/2 pouch at each feeding. We saved the rest in the fridge and fed the the rest at his second feeding. It states on the packaging that they can last 2-3 days refrigerated. I personally only trust 24 hours if prepared with formula and 2-3 days if made with water. This is because it states on the formula can that prepared formula should be discarded after 24 hours. If I still breastfed, I would trust breastmilk to last 2-3 days as well.<br /><br />TASTE. Although the food is quick dried, it tastes fresh! The peas actually taste like peas and they are actually bright green, like they should be. I've tried the foods myself before I first fed them to my son and they passed my taste test! I also love that the baby food is organic. This is very important to me that everything my son eats is free of pesticides. I am conscious about what I eat, it shouldn't be any different for my son.<br /><br />MIX & MATCH. I love that you can mix and match the baby foods together to make new flavor profiles for the baby. I am all about introducing new foods to my baby and this is the perfect way to do it! Another great idea is to add juice to the baby food once your baby is 8+ months. When my son gets older I am going to try out adding pomegranate juice to the apple variety. I don't plan of giving my son juice to drink so this is a great way to introduce him to the flavor of pomegranate.<br /><br />ECO-FRIENDLY. The packaging to completely recyclable and doesn't take of the space that canned baby food does. That means a smaller carbon footprint! In addition, the packaging is BPA-FREE. I emailed the company and asked them before I purchased the product on Amazon.<br /><br />Here is the only issue I have with NurturMe:<br /><br />CONSISTENCY. I noticed that it can be difficult to mix the baby food together to get the desired consistency. For instance, the apple was really clumpy and hard before I added the water and I had a difficult time getting all of the clumps out. Its similar to mixing formula -- you have to take extra care! My remedy for this was to use a handheld milk frother and from then on I got the perfect consistency with no clumps! I've also noticed that the peas have a little bit of a grainy texture but my son doesn't seem to mind.<br /><br />I am definitely happy with NuturMe baby food. I think it is a quick and convenient way to serve my baby organic baby food for when we are on the go! It is the best alternative I have found to homemade baby food."

I ended up just using them to sneak extra nutrition in other dishes (the squash wasn't bad mixed with mashed potatoes, but I couldn't put in too much or the little guy was on to me!).  The apple was actually a really nice consistency, a little bit of texture and tasted quite delicious.  I definitely recommend getting the variety pack before launching into a big box of one kind.

I am SO GLAD that I found Nurturme at the time I did.  It allowed me to start introducing him to solid foods, while mixing it with breastmilk or formula, so not only was he getting the calories from the food, but from the milk as well.  After several months on Nurturme, he is gaining weight at a steady rate and we no longer have to be concerned about his growth.<br />I also have a SUPER picky 3 year old who won't touch a vegetable if I cover it in chocolate and call it a Twinkie.  I am able to add a packet or two of the Nurturme veggies to her mac & cheese or other foods to sneak her in some nutrition.  Now to try that on my husband..."
14768,B0047ORGWK,A1I7VEDSLB4WT2,Lisa Linnell-Olsen,6,8,5,1299110400,"Sensible product, portable and versatile","There are many reasons to reconsider the first foods we give to babies.  The jars and the plastic containers for processed baby food are often difficult to recycle.  The processed food and the dried cereals (wheat, rice, etc.) are nothing more than empty carbs for a society facing a massive problem with the rise of type II diabetes.  Is this anything to give to a 4 month old baby?<br />To complicate matters, the World Health Organization is now recommending that babies feed on only breastmilk or formula until baby is 6 months.  The reason is that baby's small intestines cannot process the iron out of other foods until baby is six months.  As any parent can tell you, by four months of age, most babies are wanting to try other foods.<br />Nurturme baby food can help with all of this.  Each packet makes up about 2.75 oz of baby food, the same amount in a standard baby food container.  The freeze dried food is combined with breastmilk or formula, so baby can try new foods like peas, apples, squash or sweet potatoes and still get iron a form they can use, while eating a nutritious veggie instead of a starchy carb.  I know carbs are important, but they hardly seem like the best foods to introduce when energy can be supplied from formula or breastmilk.<br />The different foods can be combined to make up baby food, for example apples and sweet potatoes together.  Another versatility option is to add a little bit of nurturme to babies bottle, sort of like a baby food smoothy.<br />The freeze dried packets are super convenient.  They are easier to carry around and store than regular baby food.  After baby is six months, if a parent wanted to add water rather than milk or formula, they can.<br />The baby food tastes good, too.  Normal baby food peas tastes like horrible canned peas.  If you ever wondered why baby wouldn't eat peas, try tasting that nasty food.  The nurturme peas actually taste like fresh peas (yes, i tried them for myself). I tried all four foods in this pack, and they all tasted like fresh food.  I think that having good tasting, healthy food would be much better to introduce than nasty tasting food.  I am trying to develop good eating habits in my child, after all."

I've spent so much time staring at the baby food shelves and doing research online. I've tried Earths Best, Sprout, and Happy Baby, but I'm going to stick with Nutureme. First of all, my baby loves the taste. I love the small packaging, portability, and (most important for me) high nutritional value. I also like that it has more calories than other brands when you compare serving size. That tells me that other brands are watered down. My baby is small for his size, so I want him to have more calories per feeding. I'll feed my baby nuturme on its own or mixed with oatmeal cereal. Either way, it's super easy to use. My favorites are the apple, squash, and peas which seem exactly like their fresh counterparts. Unlike the other varieties, the dried sweet potatoes aren't as appealing as fresh. Sweet potatoes are so easy to make into baby food that I'd rather just make my own anyway. I probably wouldn't order the sweet potato version on its own, but I use it anyway as it's part of the variety pack."

I love that they are organic, they really do taste fresh and I much prefer to make it for him than give him jarred food.  I will often use a different spoon to mix it so I can lick some of it off, it tastes so good!  (the peas might be my favorite!)  Another reviewer was right, the peas end up being a bit grainy in texture; at first we just mixed it with a bit more water to make it smoother/more soupy, but now he eats it just fine at the 3 tbsp. of water mixture.  I just ordered some more as our stash was running out - a very sad thing!  I also want to try the ""froggy pasta"" recipe I saw on their blog.

14785,B003FOD6W2,AQEOGNM90LI5Q,DanJ,3,3,5,1312416000,Pure deliciousness,"For reasons known not even to me, I have purchased about 25 types of honey, made from the nectar of different flowers. Of those many types, this is my clear favorite for eating by the spoonful. It is very sweet, having only a mild flavor, and that flavor is delightful. Little or no aftertaste. I could joyfully eat far too much of this to be healthy.<br /> I have found that honey falls along a broad spectrum of flavors. There is the familiar, grocery-store flavor; clover honey and orange-blossom honey fit this description. They have a mild but distincly honey-like taste with just slight aftertaste--if you sampled an unknown type of honey and it happened to be one of these, it would seem familiar, plesant, and unremarkable. There are milder, sweeter honeys with somewhat less of the familiar honey taste and less aftertaste. Tupelo honey is one of these; starthistle honey is even milder, in my opinion, and differs somehow from the usual honey flavor in a way that I like. Then there are the progressively more strongly-flavored honeys. Avacado honey and manuka honey are these, with manuka being the stronger of the two, at least of the batches I've sampled, though there are probably differences to be had. They taste like honey, only with less sweetness, more aftertaste, and stronger flavor that still tastes like honey, though more like something that would be used as a baking flavor rather than eating by the spoonful. Eucalyptus honey (there are acually dozens of varieties of eucalyptus, of which I've tried only one generic variety so far) is also stronger in flavor, but different, with a bit of pleasant-but-medicinal aroma and aftertaste. The strongest honey I've found so far is buckwheat honey--it is dark like molasses, is as strongly flavored as molasses, and definitely fits the ""tastes like a baking flavor"" description (though I've heard it's wonderful mixed into pancake syrup, and I can believe it).<br /> There are a dozen or so honeys that are undistinguished, being a bit stronger perhaps than clover, but not so strong as manuka. For every honey that stands out as having its own flavor, there are many more that taste like a not-quite-perfect clover honey, i.e. palatable, perfectly acceptable, and perhaps a little different, but just slightly less appealing than the ubiquitous, generic clover honey.<br /> If you want a mild, sweet honey that is pleasantly different from anything else you've tried, this is it. I'll be buying more."

It was tedious, but with a good espresso blend it would make one heck of a cup of joe.  Then due to the economy I needed to scale back, so I tried Folgers Black Silk after seeing an ad (this is when it was first launched).  I became immediately hooked and it is now the only coffee I drink when I brew at home.  If you use a French Press, you're in for a treat.  Black Silk excretes a delightful nutty oil when allowed to steep that those using filtered brewers will miss out on.  This coffee is strong, deep, dark, smooth, and delicious."

Until recently, I didn't even make coffee; I just went to a local coffeehouse or Starbucks and bought what sounded good. Having decided that I would rather make coffee at home if I could find a decent approximation of the flavors I enjoyed while out and about, I started with lighter roasts. Needless to say, I was finding myself teribly disappointed by the weak results. I wanted coffee that tastes like COFFEE.<br /><br />When I decided to go for stronger flavors, I eventually settled on this one as my favorite. A dark roast, Black Silk has a strong flavor that goes great with milk and/or creamer. It does a good job of bringing the coffee flavor front and center in a pleasing way. It isn't easily pushed aside by other flavors and works well whether I feel like a more ""straight"" coffee, or something with all sorts of other elements. It isn't bitter or flat, and the aroma is heady and inviting as it brews.<br /><br />For a while there, I wasn't sure that anything I made at home could be both cost-effective AND as tasty as what the local barista could prepare for me. I am pleased to say that this is, and I find I have no interest in buying hot coffee as much when I have Black Silk on-hand. It's just great coffee at a great price that I can make at home in a matter of minutes."

I purchased a pack of 6 and it is the best commercial coffee I have ever used.<br /><br />While I prefer my Whole Bean Jet City, this coffee is far more than just acceptable.<br /><br />So, if your regular coffee is not available, try this one and Grind it on Fine and give it a try.

The other day, in a 16 hour double shift, we ran our 12 cup drip machine 10 times.  It's always a bit of an informal contest to see who can bring in the most exciting new grinds from our bean stashes.  The first time I brewed a pot of Black Silk one of the guys I worked with commented on how good it was and asked what it was.  In a very level voice I answered, ""Foldiers.""  The guy was absolutely horrified for a moment, thinking he'd lost his edge in the coffee tasting arena.  Then I told him what it was and that it was a new product and he went from horrified to merely pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />In short, this has become my go-to coffee when I run out of beans or don't want to run my noisy mill and wake everyone up in the morning!

Finally, I partook of a cup, and was surprised by how delicious it was! It is dark but not bitter. When I was a regular Starbuck's customer, I'd sometimes get a bad cup, with a bitter after taste. Not the case with this stuff. It's smooth. Keep in mind that you do have to add a little more coffee per each cup of water.

They're these little plasticized foil pouches that have a sort of bottle-like nipple'ish mouthpiece - but free flow - that the kids can suck the product out while squeezing the pouch flat. The mouthpiece itself is under the twist-off cap and is about 1/3 of an inch diameter. They have a permanent home in my go-bag as they do not require refrigeration.<br /><br />BUT they do require a clean-up crew until your child figures out how to use em. WARNING: DO NOT USE FOR FIRST TIME IN A CAR. They're so cute and you're thinking ""oh this is a perfect car snack!"" But they're not until AFTER your child learns how hard they can squeeze em. My 4 yr old was coachable and likely could have been fine unsupervized in a carseat while I drive along. But my 1 yr old? Haha, she grabbed that thing up and WOOP! Up shoots a 3 inch geyser of applesauce-like-product. It was super cute and definitely a home-movie-moment but I'm glad we usually have wipes within reach. Unless you trust your kids to eat super neatly be cautious with this product: no dressy outfits, no papers, no artwork, nothing that can't be wiped down with a moist cloth. This apple cinnamon product in particular I'm not concerned about color stains, but it is sticky and... well, it's fruit.<br /><br />Once my girls got the hang of em it's been great. I even trust my 1 yr old in the car with em - but only when I'm not alone and another passenger can clean up possible 'geyser damage.'<br /><br />I bought this during a special and signed up for Subscribe & Save and the price was far better than in stores (Amazon was ~61% of my stores price). I'm definitely going to keep purchasing this product and try out other pure blended fruit flavors - I'm a little wary of the 'touch of milk' products that require no refrigeration."

But when my wife brought one of these home she offered it to me in front of our three year old, knowing full well I wouldn't refuse in front of our little mimic! I tried to steel myself to suck it down without grimacing so my daughter wouldn't decide she didn't like it either, but I knew I was going to hate it.  WOW, was I shocked!  This stuff is great!  No mess (the reason I don't like fruit), wonderful fresh sensation, smooth creamy texture and absolutely great taste.  I'm careful about preservatives and additives in our food, and Buddy Fruits pass my muster easily.  My daughter loves it and I'm now an addict.  It works especially great in the afternoon when my sugar drops and I start wearing out.  Beats energy drinks for a quick and lasting pick me up.

She feeds it to both her breeding dogs and her show dogs.  Our dog loves it, and eats every bit of his breakfast, lunch and dinner right down.<br /><br />The breeder said for us to mix the food with a little warm water and a tablespoon of plain, unflavored, nonfat yogurt.  My vet agreed, and said that the yogurt was an excellent addition.  He also has standard poodles as his personal pets.<br /><br />As poodle owners know, the breed can be susceptible to a horrible stomach condition called ""bloat.""  Feeding your poodle a top grade dog food on a regular schedule is very important for these lovely animals.  This dog food fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />It is interesting that this is an adult dog food, but the kibble is smallish, and if mixed with the warm water while the dog is a puppy, it can be used throughout the dog's life, once he/she is weaned.

In any case, I'll still drink a diet soda if nothing else is available and I don't worry any about it. However, I discovered the Crystal Geyser flavored spring water and enjoyed it very much. I first tried the lemon and lime and the latter was my favorite. More recently, I picked up a case of the Orange. It's good! It has a nice zesty carbonation and a nice very light orange taste. I like it ice cold. It goes real well with meals and the 18-ounce bottle is just the right size.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

I do not like the taste of the tea without sweetner -- it is very bitter even when using a lower temp for the water (because its green tea) and this is the first time I've ever tasted a green tea that I didn't care for -- The Two Leaves and a Bud Jasmine Green is divine!  With sweetener, the Orange Sencha Green is tolerable (for me).  What I like about this green tea is its medicinal effects.  On the back of all Two Leaves & A Bud packages are brief statements listing what types of foods the teas pair with and/or what the tea is ""best for.""  The Orange Sencha Green Tea states that it is best for concentration ... and it is.  If I'm feeling particulary foggy headed or out of sorts (lol), I drink a mug of Orange Sencha Green and it clears my head right up!  I appreciate teas that have effective medicinal qualities that are evident within a few sips and this makes up for the unpleasant (my opinion) taste.

My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and ""deep""). I have also tried many of the products offered by ""Two Leaves and a Bud"" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).<br /><br />This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).<br /><br />The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).<br /><br />Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & ""bitty"" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.<br /><br />I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM"">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.<br /><br />Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.<br /><br />My advice: buy a single box of this first. If you like it, switch to coffee."

In fact, if you drop the dough on the cookie sheet and don't flatten it a little, you will end up with cookie mounds.  Uneven edges around each cookie will remain so -- these do not flatten out into smooth-edged discs.  The texture reminds me of homemade oatmeal cookies, actually.<br /><br />I realized after the first batch I didn't even need to butter the cookie sheet. I use aluminum bakeware yet the finished cookies came off the un-buttered sheets as if they had a non-stick coating (they don't).  I typically baked the cookies for about 14 minutes and they were soft and moist but set.  At 15 min. they were still soft, not quite as moist but not dry.<br /><br />Second, I admit I wasn't sure I liked the taste much at first. The one thing I could definitely pinpoint about the taste after the first batch was that they seemed too salty.  So for all subsequent batches I used unsalted butter and this was a big improvement.  These do not taste the same as non-GF cookies, IMO, yet they are pretty good (very good with milk) and for me they did satisfy chocolate-chip-cookie cravings**.<br /><br />**These cookies have far more chocolate chips/chunks than I find in typical cookie mixes, which helps with my evaluation, I'm sure. :)"

This makes it better, I think, as it doesn't have enough chocolate in them when I really need a chocolate fix.  The package says  to melt the butter.  You do not have to do that if you have a hand mixer with some guts.  Just use soft butter or butter substitute.  Also, watch how long they cook as mine never need the full time.

I baked 1/3 of the batter on glass, 1/3 on corningware, and 1/3 on baking sheet.  The glass batch turned out best.  The corningware batch flattened a little more than the glass batch and also was more crumbling.  The baking sheet ones tasted burnt although they didn't look burnt; the baking sheet ones looked similar to the glass batch but tasted burnt and I threw them out.  I don't know of any other gluten-free chocolate chip cookie mix that is also potato free and this one tastes great.  Reminds me of the duncan hines regular glutened-mix but not as good as the recipe on the back of Tollhouse cookies glutened cookies.<br /><br />Another very similar mix I like a little better is Authentic Foods Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix which AF just came out with and since Amazon carries AF, hopefully they will carry the Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix soon.  The ingredients for them is:  Rice Flour, Organic Granulated Can Juice, Dark Chocolate Chunks (granulated can juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, dextrose, soy lecithin, vanilla), Natural vanilla flavor, salt, baking soda, soy lechitin - Gluten-free Wheat-free May contain milk & soy  To mix add 2 eggs, 3 oz veg oil and 1 oz water.  Bake 10-15min at 375.  The Authentic Foods Chocolate Chunk Cookie holds together a little better than Pamela's.  The AF cookie has a more buttery taste whereas Pamela's has a more cocoa taste to the cookie.  I think they both get their chocolate chunks from the same supplier as they seemed identical so it is just the cookie part to compare!"

I probably have hypoglycemia---I haven't taken the definitive three-tiered test to determine if I have the condition (after fasting, you are given a drink of pure liquid glucose, and then your blood sugar is measured three times over the next several hours); however, when my doctor had me fast for twelve hours on two occasions, then measured my blood sugar level, my readings were below normal the first time and at the very low end of normal the second time. He gave me the preliminary diagnosis of hypoglycemia and warned me not to eat concentrated sugar.  The third time I had my blood-sugar tested, I had avoided concentrated sugar for a whole week, then fasted for twelve hours, and my blood-sugar reading was very normal at 90. I probably also have Candida, which is a very annoying and difficult-to-get-rid-of condition. My Candida tests showed that I have Candida, yet the readings were not high enough to merit a prescription to get rid of it (a Catch-22). Candida thrives on sugar and acidic foods. Therefore, added sugar and I are not friends, and I try to avoid the addictive stuff to the best of my willpower's ability.<br /><br />Yet I was craving homemade chocolate chip cookies last week. I haven't eaten, much less made, chocolate chip cookies in a few years! One of my friends who also has Candida (be careful of antibiotics---they can mess up your body's flora, and avoid sugar while on antibiotics and for a good few weeks after you finish taking your course of antibiotics---a lesson I learned a little too late!) said that if I ever do indulge my sweet tooth, take a TBS of Raw Apple Cider Vinegar beforehand, and it will help keep your body alkaline and therefore, offset the sugar.  I also take Cinnamon capsules or New Chapter Cinnamon gel caps to help with my blood sugar.  (If I don't take all of these precautionary pre-sugar ingesting steps, my facial dermatitis will flare up for a good three weeks, and I'll look and feel just awful.  Nothing makes you feel more unpretty than red patches of inflamed skin.  Gluten, or at least refined glutinous grain, also seems to exacerbate my dermatitis condition.) So I was stoked when I saw a gluten-free chocolate chip cookie mix in the Natural Department of a local grocery store.  I didn't feel like spending a lot of money and time chasing down organic chocolate chips, non-gluten flour, organic vanilla extract, etc. to make the cookies I was craving.<br /><br />Although I was happy to see this mix and give it a try, I honestly didn't think they'd taste especially good---enough to satisfy my craving and then I'd move on.  O Contraire.  These cookies are beyond delicious! As a person who is passionate about cooking, I can't help but mess with a recipe, even when it's already prepared for me in a mix and I only have to add an egg and butter (or in my case, a combo of Earth Balance Organic Coconut Spread and Goat's Milk butter).  I added a small amount of crushed walnuts, crushed Brazilian nuts, a spoonful of raw almond butter, and a light dusting of Cinnamon, Ground Jamaica Allspice, and Coriander Seed.  The result?  Amazing!  (I added the nuts, almond butter, and spices because I thought that that would help moderate the cookies' concentrated sugar.)  Another nice thing about this prepared mix is that it would be great for a vegan, which I briefly was (I still remain an adamant ""cruelty-free"" vegetarian), and then vegans can use applesauce for the egg and Earth Balance for the butter requirements.<br /><br />The only problem--I don't want to eat added sugar on a regular basis.  Definitely believe we should all really, really limit sugary foods, only as a special occasions treat.  These cookies make my resolution to avoid added sugar a bit more challenging.  Yet my chocolate chip cookie craving is satiated for the time being."

Most pale in comparison to the 'real' version they are trying to mimic. While this cookie mix probably couldn't go head-to-head with 'real' cookies per most peoples' standards, it certainly does for me. The mix is fool-proof and easy enough for children to make--you don't need an electric mixer at all--just mix by hand. You can add extra goodies too, though they are already very generous with the chocolate chunks. Walnuts or your favorite nut or fruit makes awesome additions.<br /><br />As for flavor, these guys are -tasty-. I really like the cocoa in the mix and although there's actually not a whole lot of sugar in them (6 g of sugar per cookie is -nothing- compared to other mixes and premade cookies), the cookies are very sweet. I've made, and served, them to regular cookie eaters (who are not gluten-free) and everyone has loved them.<br /><br />You can make these cookies more interesting by substituting coconut oil (which is full of 'good' fat and MCTs) for the butter. Do so at your discretion though---I love the taste (especially when combined with macadamia nuts), but it is certainly a subjective area. Also, as a warning, the cookies come out pretty crumbly if baked for the time specified on the packaging. I did not cook mine for the entire time suggested and remove them from the pan shortly after removing them from the oven. This has prevented any sticking and crumbling issue.<br /><br />All in all, I really like this mix and hope everyone who can't eat 'normal' cookies enjoys it too!"

I have been baking for years the old fashioned way with whole wheat but after developing Celiac I no longer could consume it. I learned later from a nutritionist that sugar was also a problem for people who have Celiac. Through trial and error I found this to be so true. Can't the makers of these mixes back off on the sugar? I removed the chips as well as they were too sweet.

But when these are not available, the French roasted chestnuts that come in a jar are typically the second best alternative but cost more than two and a half time these and do not have single serve packages.  These are the best alternative for a quick snack.  The drawback:  They are smaller, very dark and look very unappetizing although the taste is fine, but the only thing that makes me yearn for the French chestnuts is their moisture content.  Either the manufacturer is roasting these incompletely so they weigh more roasted than the French equivalent, or they must have problem with the manufacturing technique, or pack them while warm, increasing the moisture content in the bag.  At time they can be even sticky to the fingers.  Would I buy them again? Yes.  If money was no issue would I buy them? No.  I would buy the French roasted chestnuts in the glass jars.

We couldn't eat even one complete nut much less 24 pouches. Strongly would recommend that all future buyers beware of trying something in quantity that you have not tried before.
14978,B000UVKZXQ,A1DBQUS9XDHD22,Elizabeth Wray,0,1,3,1325289600,Just okay.,"They were okay.  I can't rave about them or hate them, but having had them fresh from the shell, I can definitely tell the difference.  They don't have as much taste to them (they're rather bland, actually), and they're smaller than the fresh ones I've bought.  However, they're not bad-tasting, and you don't have to mess around with shelling them.  That's one thing that keeps me from getting fresh ones more than once or twice when they're in season!<br /><br />I don't think I would use these in a recipe unless I was in a pinch, because of the bland mushiness to them, but they're just fine for snacking.  I would recommend that you try these out if you see them in the store, and then if you like them go ahead and order the 24 pouch pack.<br /><br />Give them a try.  You might like them."
14979,B000UVKZXQ,A17771LTRWSKQ5,Helen S. Lam,2,5,1,1335225600,Slimey and disgusting!,"My initial taste of these roasted chestnuts were positive!  However, after a week, the remaining chestnusts in the ziplock bag turned slimey and is covered with an unappetizing goo.  I had to throw away the rest of the bag for fear of spoilage.  DO NOT BUY!"

They are not the color of chestnuts, plus they are wet in the package and the taste and texture is way off.  I had to order 24 packs of them and they are not-returnable and yet I cannot even finish the first pack.  I would really suggest either get your chestnuts fresh and roast them yourselves or do without because if you are like me who has been roasting and enjoying for 50+ years you will be terribly disappointed."
14981,B000UVKZXQ,A23U2QWUBNN3R2,E. Bouscher,0,2,1,1325808000,The most disgusting thing I have ever tasted...,"Plus they would not accept returns after I opened them...BEWARE of these.  I was expecting something that resembled a chestnut but it tasted like moldy gunk.  If there were negative stars, this product would receive negative...<br />Make sure you purchase directly from Amazon because the other sellers don't allow returns.  I had to throw the whole case of 24 away."

14984,B000EGZ99M,A2P4M971556NDD,D. Simonson,17,18,5,1168041600,Good buy!,"I'd been looking for whole wheat orzo for awhile, and it's almost impossible to find in any grocery stores. This is a very great pasta at a reasonable price. I've been very pleased with this pasta. One thing - If you are accustomed to the enriched wheat (non-whole grain) orzo, this is a lot firmer - and another thing I've noticed is that It develops a grainy texture if I leave a pasta in the fridge overnight."
14985,B000EGZ99M,A3PHH35EEUGD02,E. Bielaski,6,6,4,1231200000,"Found, at last.",I have been looking for this whole wheat orzo for the last year and none of my area grocery stores carry it. So I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  It is very tasty made with sauteed green onions and several cloves of garlic and then added to 14 oz. boiled chicken broth and then simmered for 15 mins. (using 1 cup of the orzo).  Very yummy tasting and good for you too.

14987,B000EGZ99M,A2ITCDJ4BW1XNQ,Perrin,3,3,5,1260057600,"Perfect pasta, healthy choice","This orzo is absolutely delicious, with a firm bite and an astounding 9 g of fiber in every serving (and when it comes to pasta, that's what you should be looking for on the package). This is the healthiest and most delicious choice I've found in whole grain pastas, bar none. The orzo shape is great for cold salads and hot dishes alike -- I really like making a hot caprese-style pasta dish with this stuff. I don't buy anything else ... and you can't beat Amazon's price for the 4-pack, particularly if you select the automatic shipment option (I get a new pack every 3 months)."
14988,B000EGZ99M,A2R6X1ADKL3BN4,Jeanne Bruton,3,3,5,1257724800,ECONOMICAL WAY TO BUY A HARD TO FIND PRODUCT,"After searching unsuccessfully in many grocery stores for whole wheat orzo, I was delighted to find this product at Amazon.  Although you have to buy a lot, the shelf life is excellent, and the price is quite reasonable.  I prefer the taste and texture to regular orzo, and the health benefit of whole grains is a plus.  Although the directions tell you to boil and drain it like pasta, I cook it like rice.  Simmer 1 cup orzo in 2 cups liquid stirring occassionally until liquid is absorbed and pasta is tender."

(Now if I could also find whole grain orecchiette too, hint). With 9 grams of fiber per 2oz serving, this orzo delivers high fiber, just what I wanted.  Use it in rice dishes like pilafs and stuffed peppers, add to soups, or just serve as a side dish on its own w/butter and sage, etc..no need to go back to white orzo anymore."
14991,B000EGZ99M,A1EEZZAZVKHSNX,95wombat,2,2,5,1229212800,Great food,"We've been looking all over for a wheat orzo and decided to try this. It has worked very well in all our orzo recipes, hot and cold, save for one that was just OK. It has a stronger flavor than regular pasta made with bleached flour, so it does best in recipes with bolder flavors. Like most wheat pastas, it needs to be boiled for just the shortest amount of time, so that it remains very firm. We haven't overcooked it yet, so I can't say if it will get mealy and mushy like a lot of wheat pastas do. Highly recommended."
14992,B000EGZ99M,A1KL8X67ZL8NE1,Ginger Rose,2,2,5,1219363200,Great stuff,"Whole wheat orzo is pretty hard to find in the stores.  I try to eat only whole grain pasta, bread, etc.  I love the texture and it is delicious.  I don't mind buying 4 jars at once because dried, sealed pasta keeps for so long."

My daughter liked both of them really well. In the second receipe I didn't have the seasoning quite like it should have been but both recipes I tried were good.  I will work on the seasoning.  I liked the idea of having something that cooked so quickly, was whole wheat, organic, etc."

When my husband was diagnoses with diabetes last year we decided to go with whole wheat pasta, he loves pasta but the type made from refined white flour was really messing up his blood sugar. I had a really hard time finding whole wheat orzo in the local stores, so we tried this product and it's perfect and so convenient to get recurring orders of it as well! Thank you RiceSelect & Amazon!"
